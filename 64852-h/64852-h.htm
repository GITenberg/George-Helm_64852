<small>BEHIND THE BEARD</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">A COMET so dim that it is almost
invisible will cause agitated interest
in the heavens where great
fixed stars blaze nightly unnoticed. Harrison
was a large Ohio river town, and in
its firmament blazed many and considerable
fixed stars&mdash;presenting pretty nearly all
varieties of peculiarity in appearance and
condition. But when George Helm appeared
everybody concentrated upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see that young fellow with the
red whiskers stumping down Main Street
this afternoon?&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Did you see that jay in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
the funny frock coat and the stove pipe
hat?&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;Who&#8217;s the big hulking chap that
looks as if he&#8217;d just landed from nowhere?&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;I
saw the queerest looking mud-dauber
of a lawyer or doctor&mdash;or maybe preacher&mdash;sitting
on the steps of Mrs. Beaver&#8217;s
boarding-house.&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;I saw him, too. He
had nice eyes&mdash;gray and deep-set&mdash;and they
twinkled as if he were saying, &#8216;Yes, I know
I&#8217;m a joke of a greenhorn, but I&#8217;m human,
and I like you, and I&#8217;d like you to like
me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>In towns, even the busiest of them, there
is not any too much to talk about. Also,
there is always any number of girls and
widows sharply on the lookout for bread-winners;
and the women easily get the men
into the habit of noting and sizing up newly
arrived males. No such new arrival,
whether promising as a provider or not, escapes
searching attention. Certainly there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
was in young George Helm&#8217;s appearance no
grace or beauty to detain the professional
glance of a husband-seeker with a fancy for
romantic ornamentation of the business of
matrimony. Certainly also there was in
that appearance no suggestion of latent
possibilities of luxury-providing. A plain,
serious-looking young man with darkish
hair and a red beard, with a big loosely
jointed body whose legs and arms seemed
unduly long. A strong, rather homely face,
stern to sadness in repose, flashing unexpectedly
into keen appreciation of wit and
fun when the chance offered. The big
hands were rough from the toil of the fields&mdash;so
rough that they would remain the
hands of the manual laborer to the end.
The cheap, smooth frock suit and the not
too fresh top hat had the air of being their
wearer&#8217;s only costume, of having long
served in that capacity, of getting the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
prudent care because they could not soon be
relieved of duty.</p>

<p>&#8220;He lives in the room my boy Tom made
out of the attic last summer,&#8221; said Mrs.
Beaver, who supported her husband and
children by taking in boarders. &#8220;And all
he brung with him was in a paper shirt
box. He wears a celluloid collar and cuffs,
and he sponges off his coat and vest and
pants every morning before he puts &#8217;em on.
So Tom says. He lies awake half the night
reading or writing in bed&mdash;sometimes when
he reads he laughs out loud, so you&#8217;d think
he had company. And he sings hymns and
recites poetry. And, my! how he does eat!
Them long legs of his&#8217;n is hollow clear
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is no doubt about the red beard.
Since George Helm has become famous, the
legend is that he always had a smooth face.
But like most of the legends about him&mdash;like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
that about his astonishing success and
astounding marriage&mdash;this legend of the
smooth face is as falsely inaccurate as most
of the stuff that passes for truth about the
men of might who have come up from the
deep obscurity of the masses. It was a hideous
red beard&mdash;of the irritating shade of
bright red with which brick walls used to be&mdash;perhaps
in some parts of the world still
are&mdash;painted in the spring. It grew patchily.
In spots it was straight; in other spots,
curly. It was so utterly out of harmony
with his hair that opinion divided as to
which was dyed, and the wonder grew that
he did not dye both to some common and
endurable shade.</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he wear those whiskers for?&#8221;&mdash;&#8220;How
can a man with hair like that on
his face expect to get clients or anything
else?&#8221; Nevertheless, public opinion&mdash;which
is usually wrong about everything, including<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
its own exaggerated esteem for itself&mdash;was
wrong in this case. As soon as a comet
ceases to be a visitor and settles down into
a fixed inhabitant with a regular orbit it
ceases to attract attention, becomes obscure,
acquires the dangerous habit of obscurity.
George Helm, only twenty-four years old
and without money, friends or influence,
might have been driven back to the farm
but for that beard.</p>

<p>Successful men feed their egotism with
such shallow and silly old proverbial stuff
as, &#8220;You can&#8217;t keep a good man down,&#8221; and
&#8220;A husky hog will get its nose to the
trough.&#8221; But they reckon ill who leave circumstance
out of account in human affairs.
And circumstance does not mean opportunity
seen and seized, but opportunity that
takes man by the nape of the neck and forcibly
thrusts him into responsibility and painfully
compels him to acquire the education<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
that finally leads to success. Those who
arrive forget that they were not always wise
and able; they forget how hardly they got
wisdom and capacity, how fiercely their
native human inertia and stupidity fought
against learning. If some catastrophe&mdash;which
God forbid!&mdash;should wipe out at a
stroke all our leaders&mdash;all the geniuses who
give us employment, run our affairs, write
our books and newspapers, make our laws,
blow the whistles for us to begin and to stop
work, tell us when to go forth and when to
come in out of the rain&mdash;if some cataclysm
should orphan us entirely of these our
wondrous wise guardians, don&#8217;t you suspect
that circumstance would almost overnight
create a new set for us, quite as good, perhaps
better? The human race is a vast
reservoir of raw material for any and all
human purposes. Let those who find cheer
in feeling lonely in their unique, inborn, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>evitable
greatness enjoy themselves to their
fill. It is their privilege. But it is also the
privilege of plain men and twinkling stars
to laugh at them.</p>

<p>So, George Helm&#8217;s beard may have had
more to do with his destiny than his conventional
biographers will ever concede. He
ceased to be a comet. But he did not cease
to attract attention. And his awkwardness,
his homeliness and his solitary &#8220;statesman&#8217;s&#8221;
suit would not have sufficed to keep
him in the public eye. That preposterous
beard was vitally necessary. It accomplished
its mission. The months&mdash;the clientless
months&mdash;the months of dwindling
purse and hope passed. George Helm remained
a figure in Harrison. Some men
were noted for the toilets or the eccentricity
or the beauty of their wives, some men for
their fortunes or their fine houses, some men
for dog or horse or high power automobile.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
George Helm was noted for his beard. It
served as the gathering center for jokes and
stories. The whole town knew all sorts of
gossip about that &#8220;boy with the whiskers,&#8221;
for, through the carmine mask, the boyishness
had finally been descried. The local
papers, hard put for matter to fill the space
round patent medicine advertisements and
paid news of dry goods, overshoes and
canned vegetables at cut prices, often
made paragraphs about the whiskers. And
the heartiest laugh at these jests came
from serious, studious George Helm himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you shave &#8217;em, George?&#8221;&mdash;He
was of those men whom everybody calls
by the first name.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never happened to see me without
&#8217;em?&#8221; Helm would reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to,&#8221; was usually the retort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve seen myself without &#8217;em&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
I guess I&#8217;m choosing the bluntest horn
of the dilemma.&#8221;</p>

<p>It never occurred to any one in Harrison
to wonder why, while George Helm&#8217;s
whiskers were a butt, the young man himself
was not. When Rostand made a tragic
hero of a man with a comic nose, there was
much outcry at the marvelous genius displayed
in the feat. In fact, that particular
matter required no genius at all. There is
scarcely an individual of strongly marked
personality who has not some characteristic,
mental or physical, that is absurd, ridiculous.
Go over the list of great men, past
and present; note the fantastic, grotesque
physical peculiarities alone. Those attention-arresting
peculiarities helped, you will
observe, not hindered, the man in coming
into his own&mdash;the pot-belly of little Napoleon,
the duck legs of giant Washington, the
drooling and twitching of Sam Johnson.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Try how you will, you cannot make a
man ridiculous, unless he is ridiculous.
Lincoln could&mdash;and did&mdash;play the clown
hours at a time. Yet only shallow fools of
conventionality-worshipers for an instant
confused the man and the clever story-actor.
Harrison laughed at George Helm&#8217;s
whiskers; but it did not, because it could
not, laugh at George Helm.</p>

<p>But, being a shallow-pated town, Harrison
fancied it was laughing at Helm himself.
It is the habit of human beings to mistake
clothes and whiskers and all manner of
mere externals for men. Occasionally they
discover their mistake. Harrison discovered
its mistake.</p>

<p>It nominated George Helm for Circuit
Judge. There were two parties in that
district&mdash;as there are everywhere else&mdash;the
Republican and the Democratic. There
was also&mdash;as wherever else there is any public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
thing to steal&mdash;a third party that owned
and controlled the other two. Sometimes
this third party &#8220;fixes&#8221; the race so that
Republican always wins and Democrat
always loses; again, it &#8220;fixes&#8221; the race the
other way; yet again&mdash;where there is what
is known as an &#8220;intelligent and alert electorate&#8221;&mdash;this
shrewd third party alternately
puppets Republican and Democrat first
under the wire&mdash;and then how the aforesaid
intelligent and alert people do shout and
applaud their own sagacity and independence!</p>

<p>They say that woman is lacking in the
sense of humor. There must be something
in the charge. Otherwise, would she not
long ago have laughed herself to death at
the political antics of man?</p>

<p>In Harrison and its surrounding country
the sentiment was overwhelmingly Republican&mdash;which
meant that the majority of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
&#8220;independent&#8221; farmers and artisans who
were working early and late to enrich the
Railway Trust, the Harvester Trust, the
Beef Trust, the Money Trust, and the rest
of the members of the third and only real
party, said, when they sat doddering about
politics, &#8220;Wall, I reckon I&#8217;ll keep on voting
as I shot.&#8221; If the community had been
Democratic, the dodder would have been,
&#8220;I think it&#8217;s about time to turn the rascals
out.&#8221; Needless to say, the third party
cares not a rap which side wins. The vote
goes into the ballot box Republican or
Democratic; it is counted for the third
party. In Harrison the Republican candidates
of the third party always won, and its
Democratic candidates were put up simply
to make things interesting for the populace
and to give them the feeling that they were
sovereign citizens. The Republican candidate
for Circuit Judge, the candidate slated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
to win in a walk, was Judge Powers. He
had served two terms, to the entire content
of the third party&mdash;and, being full of pious
talk and solemn flapdoodle about the &#8220;sacredness
of the judicial trust in a community
of freemen,&#8221; to the entire content of the
people. In a hilarious mood the Democratic
machine, casting about for its sacrifice
candidate, nominated George Helm&mdash;or,
rather, George Helm&#8217;s whiskers.</p>

<p>It was a side-splitting joke. Everybody
liked George. Everybody knew about his
whiskers&mdash;knew him by his whiskers. It
bade fair to inject that humor, so dearly
beloved of the American people, into what
was usually a dull campaign. The only
trouble was that for the first time Helm
failed to see a joke.</p>

<p>The night of his nomination the light in
Mrs. Beaver&#8217;s tiny, stuffy attic room went
out early. And if you could have looked in,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
you would have discovered, by the starlight
that the big form was lying quite still
in the little bed which sagged and bulged
with it. But George Helm was not
asleep. He slept not a wink that whole
night. And as soon as he had finished
breakfast he went down to the barber shop
at the corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bob,&#8221; said he to the colored proprietor,
&#8220;I want a clean shave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that, Mr. Helm?&#8221; exclaimed the
amazed barber. And two loungers at the
table where the sporting papers were spread
out sat up and stared.</p>

<p>&#8220;A clean shave, Bob,&#8221; said Helm gravely,
seating himself in the chair.</p>

<p>Bob started a broad grin that, with the
least encouragement, would have become a
guffaw&mdash;and would have echoed throughout
the district. But he did not get the encouragement.
Instead, he saw something in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
the kind, deep-set gray eyes, in the strong,
sad mouth and chin, that set him soberly to
work. The two loungers went outside to
laugh and spread the news. But when they
got outside they did not laugh. Why? It
is impossible to explain the psychology of
man the mass. They put the astounding
news into currency&mdash;but not as a joke.
Helm was shaving his beard. What did it
mean?</p>

<p>&#8220;Our opponents,&#8221; said Judge Powers,
&#8220;nominated a set of whiskers. The whiskers
have disappeared&mdash;so there is no one
running against us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The jest, being of the species which it is
conventional to utter and to laugh at on
stump and after-dinner occasions, got its
momentary due of cackling and braying.
But the mirth did not spread. For, before
noon of that first day of the campaign, it
had been discovered that the Democratic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
machine had not nominated whiskers, but a
man.</p>

<p>We are in the habit of regarding a human
being as a mere conglomerate of sundry
familiar conventionalities&mdash;of dress, of
manner, of thought. We have formed the
habit because with an occasional rare exception
a human being is simply that and nothing
more. So an individuality is always a
startling apparition&mdash;fascinating, perhaps,
certainly terrifying. The coming of a man
makes us suddenly aware how few real men
there are&mdash;real live men&mdash;how most of us
are simply patterns of men who once lived,
or, rather, differently proportioned composites
of all past men. The excitement in
peaceful Harrison and its somnolent environs
was almost hysterical. For, in all
that region, there was not, there had not
been for years&mdash;not since the stern, elemental
pioneer days&mdash;a real living man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
All the specimens of the genus homo were
of the approved type of the past.</p>

<p>George Helm, <i>man</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;George,&#8221; said Bill Desbrough, who had
a law office across the hall in the same
building&mdash;the Masonic Temple&mdash;&#8220;George,
where&#8217;d you ever get the notion of those
there whiskers you&#8217;ve just shed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the girls,&#8221; replied George. &#8220;When
I was a boy and a youngster the girls made
fun of my face. So I hid it as soon as I
could&mdash;as well as I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fool women!&#8221; exclaimed Desbrough
in disgust. &#8220;Why, George, you&#8217;ve got a
<i>face</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid so,&#8221; said George with a rueful
grin, passing his hand over the newly
emerged visage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid so!&#8221; cried Desbrough. &#8220;Let me
tell you, old man, a face&mdash;a real face&mdash;is
about the rarest thing in the world. Most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
so-called faces are nothing but front sides of
heads.&#8221; Desbrough looked at the &#8220;face&#8221;
narrowly, searchingly. &#8220;Helm, I believe
you are a great man.&#8221;</p>

<p>George laughed delightedly and derisively&mdash;as
a sensible man does at a compliment.
&#8220;Oh, shucks!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow,&#8221; said Desbrough, &#8220;if you&#8217;d
have produced that face a day earlier, you&#8217;d
never have got the nomination. A man
with a face never gets anything from the
powers-that-be, without a fight, until he has
put himself squarely on record as being
with them. Even then they&#8217;re always a
little afraid of him.&#8221; Desbrough nodded
thoughtfully. &#8220;And they may well be,
damn &#8217;em,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;I&#8217;ve got the nomination,&#8221; said
Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what you&#8217;ll do with it,&#8221; said
his friend.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;<i>I&#8217;m</i> wondering what it&#8217;ll do with <i>me</i>,&#8221;
replied Helm.</p>

<p>Desbrough glanced at him curiously.</p>

<p>George went on to explain. &#8220;Yesterday,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;I was a boy of twenty-five&#8221;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all you are!&#8221; cried Desbrough.
&#8220;Why, even without the whiskers I&#8217;d have
said thirty-five.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m one of those chaps who are born
old,&#8221; laughed Helm. &#8220;I had lines and even
wrinkles when I was eighteen. I&#8217;ll look
younger at forty than I do now. Mother
used to say I reminded her of her father&mdash;that
he was homely enough to stop a clock
when he was young and kept getting handsomer
as he got older.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the kind,&#8221; said Bill Desbrough,
&#8220;and it&#8217;s the best kind to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As I was saying,&#8221; proceeded George,
&#8220;yesterday I was a boy. As soon as those
fellows nominated me&mdash;they were laughing&mdash;they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
thought it was a fine old joke&mdash;but,
Bill, a queer sort of a something happened
inside me. A kind of shock, like a man
jumping out of a sound sleep to find the
house afire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Desbrough was interestedly watching the
face of his friend. Its expression was indeed
strange&mdash;the look of power&mdash;sad, stern, inexorable&mdash;the
look of the men whose wills
and passions hurl them on and on to the conquest
of the world. Suddenly it changed,
softened. The human lines round the mobile,
handsome mouth appeared. The gray
eyes twinkled and danced. &#8220;So you see,
Bill,&#8221; said he, &#8220;the nomination didn&#8217;t lose
any time in beginning to do things to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the whiskers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they had to go,&#8221; said George simply.
&#8220;The fight was on, and a fellow naturally
throws away all the foolishness before he
jumps in.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>&#8220;So you&#8217;re going to make a fight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said George. &#8220;What else is
there to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean I can&#8217;t lose. I&#8217;ve got nothing
<i>to</i> lose.&#8221;</p>

<p>About the most dangerous character on
this earth is a real man who has nothing to
lose. When the powers-that-be discover
such an one, and are convinced that he is
indeed a real man and not a cunning bluff at
it, they hasten to give him something to
lose. They don&#8217;t feel safe until he has wife
and children, or wealth, or position&mdash;something
that will fill one arm and make the
other cautious.</p>

<p>The three counties constituting that judicial
district will not in many a year forget
the first Helm campaign. In its second
week Judge Powers canceled his speaking
dates, giving out that he regarded it as undignified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
for a judge to descend in the
ermine to the political arena and scramble
and tussle for votes. The truth was that
George Helm had driven him to cover because
he dared not face the facts of his judicial
record as the young candidate proclaimed
it throughout those counties, on the
highways, in the by-ways no less, in town,
in village, in country.</p>

<p>The day he began campaigning George
counted his cash, found that in all the world
he had three hundred and forty-seven dollars
and fifty-six cents. He had been calculating
that this money would keep him
housed and fed and officed for about a year
longer, assuming that he continued to be
absolutely without clients. Then&mdash;he would
teach school and toss hay and stack sacks at
the threshing machine until he had put by
the money for another two years&#8217; try. To
go into the campaign meant to use up his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
resources in two months&mdash;for he could not
hope to get any help from the Democratic
machine. Its &#8220;contributions&#8221; from the various
corporations would be used in paying
the leaders and their henchmen for refraining
from &#8220;doing anything disturbing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, Mr. Helm,&#8221; said Pat Branagan,
the local Democratic boss, &#8220;but we can&#8217;t
spare you a cent for your campaign.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I calculated,&#8221; said Helm.</p>

<p>Branagan had changed toward Helm the
instant he saw him without a beard. Branagan
had not risen to be boss without learning
a thing or two about human nature and
human faces. &#8220;There&#8217;s no hope for you,&#8221;
proceeded he. &#8220;And anyhow I think a judicial
candidate ought to be dignified.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t see any objection to his
showing himself to the people,&#8221; said
George, &#8220;and letting them judge whether
he&#8217;s honest and sensible, and letting them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
hear what his notion of justice is&mdash;whether
he&#8217;s for rich man&#8217;s reading of the law or
for honest man&#8217;s reading of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Branagan puffed thoughtfully at his
cigar. If he had been looking at Helm, he
might have seen a covert twinkle in those
expressive gray eyes. But he was not looking
at Helm; he didn&#8217;t like to look at him.
&#8220;Yes, I suppose so, Mr. Helm,&#8221; he said.
He had called Helm George&mdash;George, with
a humorous grin&mdash;until Bob Williams, the
colored barber, performed that magic feat.
&#8220;But there won&#8217;t be no money for meetings.
Meetings means hall rent and posters and
processions, and them little knickknacks
costs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I can look after that,&#8221; said
George, crossing and uncrossing his long
legs and smoothing out a tail of his shiny
black frock upon his knee.</p>

<p>&#8220;You allow to do some speaking?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to hire a horse and buggy and
move about some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. You may stir up a little
law business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Done any orating?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ve heard a lot of speeches, and
I&#8217;ve made a few.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you know the kind of stuff to hand
out to the people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; said Helm.</p>

<p>Branagan was obviously relieved when
Helm departed&mdash;the conference was held in
Pat&#8217;s saloon which was the &#8220;hang-out&#8221; for
the politicians and other disreputables of
the town. The first class really included
the last, for there was not a disreputable
who was not actively engaged in &#8220;practical&#8221;
politics. Helm negotiated with the livery-man
round the corner from Mrs. Beaver&#8217;s
boarding-house, got a buggy and a sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
horse for two months at two dollars and a
half a day, he to feed the horse, keep the
buggy in repair and do his own driving.
The morning of the second day after he secured
the nomination, he opened his campaign.</p>

<p>Two days later&mdash;or rather, three nights
later&mdash;so far into the third night that it was
near the dawn of the third day&mdash;a stalled
automobile shot the powerful beams from
its acetylene lamps into the woods near
Bixby Cross Roads, about twenty miles to
the northeast of Harrison. The light fell
upon a buggy, with the horse taken from the
shafts and hitched to a nearby tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi, there&mdash;I say!&#8221; came in a man&#8217;s voice
from the darkness of the auto.</p>

<p>This was followed a moment later by,
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be jiggered!&#8221; in the same voice,
accompanied by the subdued laughter of
two women, on the rear seat of the auto.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
The cause of the exclamation was the apparition
of a head above the side of the bed
of the buggy, and behind the seat&mdash;the head
of a man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he&#8217;s curled up in his buggy to
sleep,&#8221; said one of the women in a low
voice.</p>

<p>But the night was still and the voice
had the carrying quality; so George Helm
heard distinctly. As he was as shy as any
man is apt to be who feels that he is not
attractive to women, the sound of a woman&#8217;s
voice&mdash;a young woman&#8217;s voice&mdash;threw him
into a panic. He was acutely conscious of
the fact that the frock suit neatly folded was
under the buggy seat, and that he had nothing
on over his underclothes but the lap
robe. In his alarm he cried out, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
come any nearer. What do you want to
know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve punctured a tire,&#8221; said the man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
&#8220;And we&#8217;ve lost our way. Will you come
and help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn those lights the other way,&#8221; said
Helm.</p>

<p>There was a chuckle from the direction
of the auto, a sound of suppressed female
laughter. The sound rose, swelled until the
two women and their man and presently
George Helm were all four laughing uproariously.
The lights turned in another
direction. &#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Helm. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
with you in a minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>And it was scarcely more than that when
he, clad in the frock suit and carrying the
top hat in his hand, advanced toward the
auto. &#8220;Now&mdash;what can I do for you?&#8221;
inquired he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know how to fit on a tire?&#8221; said
the man&mdash;he was young, about George&#8217;s
age&mdash;but a person of fashionable dress and
manner.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know a thing about automobiles,&#8221;
replied Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I do, Bart,&#8221; said one of the women&mdash;the
one with the sweeter voice. &#8220;I can
superintend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are we far from the main road?&#8221; said
Bart to Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;About a mile and a half.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to disturb you. I&#8217;m Barton
Hollister.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man spoke the name as if he
were certain of its being recognized. &#8220;Oh,
yes, I know you, Mr. Hollister. We come
from the same town&mdash;Harrison. I&#8217;m
George Helm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of you,&#8221; said young Hollister
graciously. &#8220;I suppose we&#8217;ve never happened
to meet because I&#8217;m at home so little.
You&#8217;ve lost your way, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m making a campaign through the
district.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>&#8220;Oh&mdash;yes. You were nominated by the
Democrats for&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hollister hesitated awkwardly.
&#8220;For Circuit Judge,&#8221; Helm supplied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Against my cousin, Judge Powers.
These ladies are my sister Clara and Miss
Clearwater.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm bowed to the ladies, who smiled
graciously at him. He could see their faces
now&mdash;lovely, delicate faces with the look of
the upper class&mdash;the sort of women he had
seen only at a distance and had met only in
novels and memoirs.</p>

<p>&#8220;The chauffeur was sick and I was ass
enough to risk coming without him,&#8221; said
Hollister. &#8220;Nell, you&#8217;ll have to tell us what
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>There followed about the most interesting
and exciting hour of George Helm&#8217;s life up
to that time. Within five minutes Barton
Hollister had shown that he was worse than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
useless for the work in hand, had been swept
aside by Helm and Miss Clearwater. He
smoked and fussed about and quarreled
with his sister, who was in no very good
humor with him&mdash;&#8220;casting us away in the
wilderness at three o&#8217;clock in the morning.&#8221;
Helm and the girl who knew toiled at removing
the tire and replacing it. She did
not know very much; so in the end Helm
became boss and, with her assistance,
worked out the problem from its foundations.</p>

<p>It isn&#8217;t easy for an intelligent human being
to say so much as three sentences without
betraying his intelligence. And in an
emergency the evidences of superior mind
stand out clearly and brilliantly. Thus it
came to pass that in the hour&#8217;s work George
Helm and Eleanor Clearwater got a respect
each for the other&#8217;s intelligence. His respect
for her was so great that he all but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
forgot her loveliness and her remote removal
from the sphere of his humble, toilsome
life. He was tempted to prolong the
task, in spite of the irritation of Clara Hollister&#8217;s
railing, peevish voice. But he resisted
the temptation and got his visitors into
condition for departure with all the speed
he could command.</p>

<p>They thanked him effusively. There was
handshaking all round. Hollister and his
sister urged him to call &#8220;soon&#8221;&mdash;a diplomatic
invitation; it sounded cordial, yet&mdash;was
safely vague. The automobile departed,
and the candidate for judge was free
to resume his repose in the airy chamber he
had selected, to save time and hotel bills.</p>

<p>Two hours later he made a thorough
toilet with the assistance of a convenient
spring, hitched up his horse and drove out
of the woods and into the by-road to search
for a farm-house and breakfast. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
about a mile, and just before he reached the
main road, he saw ahead of him an auto&mdash;the
auto. In his shyness he reined in his
horse and looked round for some way to
escape. He, the homely, the obscure, the
wretchedly poor, the badly dressed, the
grotesque straggler for a foothold in life&mdash;&#8220;as
ridiculous as a turtle on its back and
trying to get right side up&#8221;&mdash;what had he
to do with those rich, grand, elegant people?
When they saw him in the full light
of day, needing a shave and none too tidy
after his interrupted night out, they would
humiliate him with their polite but not to
be concealed disdain of him. Bart Hollister
suddenly sprang from the auto and shouted
and waved. There was nothing to do but
go on.</p>

<p>Another tire had exploded, and Bart had
not dared leave the two girls alone; besides,
he would have been lost the instant he got<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
beyond the range of the lights. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
been dozing in the car and hoping you&#8217;d
come along,&#8221; he ended. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;re
cursing the day you ever saw us. But&mdash;couldn&#8217;t
you help put on another tire?&#8221;</p>

<p>A few minutes, and Helm and Eleanor
Clearwater were at work again. But his
fingers were much clumsier now, and he was
wretchedly self-conscious. By daylight he
saw her to be the loveliest woman&mdash;so he
decided&mdash;that he had ever seen. About
twenty years old, with thick hair of the
darkish neutral shade that borrows each
moment new colors and tints from the light;
with very dark gray eyes, so dark that an
observer less keen than Helm might have
thought them brown. She was neither tall
nor short, had one of those figures that
make you forget inches, and think only of
line and proportion. A good straight nose,
a sweet yet rather haughty mouth. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
hands&mdash;he noted them especially as he and
she worked&mdash;were delicate, had a singular
softness that somehow contrived to combine
with firmness. They were cool to the
touch&mdash;and her voice was cool, even when
talking intimately with Clara Hollister and
her brother. Not the haughty reserve of
caste, but the attractive human reserve of
those to whom friendship and love are not
mere words but deep and lasting emotions.</p>

<p>When he took off his coat to go to work
Helm was so thoroughly flustered that he
did not think of his linen&mdash;or rather, of his
cotton and celluloid&mdash;or of the torn back of
his waistcoat, or of the discolored lining of
his coat. But when he was ready to resume
the coat he suddenly saw and felt all these
horrors of his now squalid poverty. She
was apparently unaware; but he knew that
she too had seen, had felt. Unconsciously
he looked at her with a humble yet proud<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
appeal&mdash;the effort the soul sometimes makes
to face directly another soul, with no misleading
veil of flesh and other externals
between. Their eyes met; she colored
faintly and glanced away.</p>

<p>Clara and Barton were for dashing
straight on home to breakfast&mdash;a run of
about three-quarters of an hour. But Miss
Clearwater was not for the risk. &#8220;I&#8217;m
starved,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I&#8217;ve worked hard, with
these two tires. Mr. Helm will find us
breakfast in this neighborhood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going to ask them to give me
something at Jake Hibbard&#8217;s, about half a
mile further on,&#8221; said Helm. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be plain
food, but pretty good.&#8221;</p>

<p>And it was pretty good&mdash;coffee, fresh
milk, corn bread, fried chicken and potatoes,
corn cakes and maple syrup. Barton
and Clara ate sparingly. It made George
Helm feel closer to the goddess to see that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
she ate as enthusiastically as did he. &#8220;I
never saw you eat like this, Nell,&#8221; said
Clara, not altogether admiring.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never saw me when I had things I
really liked,&#8221; replied she.</p>

<p>&#8220;The way to get your food to be really
tasty,&#8221; observed Mrs. Hibbard, &#8220;is to
earn it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Clearwater deigned to be interested
in Mr. Helm&#8217;s campaign. &#8220;I know something
about politics,&#8221; said she. &#8220;My father
was United States Senator a few years
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;you&#8217;re George Clearwater&#8217;s daughter?&#8221;
said Helm. He knew all about Clearwater,
the lumber &#8220;king&#8221; who had bought
a seat in the Senate because his wife thought
she&#8217;d like Washington socially.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the girl. &#8220;I&#8217;m the only
child. And you&mdash;are you going to be
elected?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>&#8220;Judge Powers&#8217;s plurality was more than
his opponent&#8217;s whole vote last time,&#8221; said
Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you haven&#8217;t much hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hope&mdash;I work,&#8221; said Helm.</p>

<p>As they talked on, he saying nothing beyond
what was necessary to answer the
questions put to him, it was curious to see
how he, the homely and the shabby, became
the center of interest. His personality compelled
them to think and to talk about him,
to revolve round him&mdash;this, though he was
shrinking in his shyness and could scarcely
find words or utterance for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a queer man,&#8221; said Clara, when
the auto was under way again. &#8220;He&#8217;s very
dowdy and ugly, but somehow you sort of
like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not so ugly,&#8221; said Miss Clearwater.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not&mdash;for a man of his class,&#8221;
said Clara. &#8220;I like to meet the lower-class<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
people once in awhile. They&#8217;re very interesting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess,&#8221; said Miss Clearwater, absently,
&#8220;that father was a good deal that
sort of a man when he was young.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clara laughed. &#8220;Oh, nonsense,&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;Your father amounted to something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He started as a pack peddler.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clara would not be outdone in generous
candor. &#8220;Well&mdash;papa was a farm
hand. Don&#8217;t all that sort of thing seem
terribly far away, Nell? Just look at
<i>us</i>. Think of <i>us</i> marrying a man like this
Helm.&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Clearwater shivered. &#8220;He was
pretty dreadful&mdash;wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose the poor fellow ever had
a decent suit in his life&mdash;or ever before met
ladies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet,&#8221; said Miss Clearwater, absent and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
reflective, &#8220;there&#8217;s no telling what he&#8217;ll be,
before he gets through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Talking about your conquest, Nell?&#8221;
called Bart from the front seat.</p>

<p>Miss Clearwater colored haughtily. Clara
cried, &#8220;Don&#8217;t be rude, Bart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rude?&#8221; retorted Hollister. &#8220;Anyone
could see with half an eye that he was overhead
in love with Nell. Wait till he comes
to call.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Call?&#8221; Clara laughed. &#8220;He&#8217;d never
venture to appear at our front door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go to hear him when he strikes
Harrison,&#8221; said Bart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed we&#8217;ll not,&#8221; replied his sister.
&#8220;He&#8217;d misunderstand and presume. Don&#8217;t
you think so, Nell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Miss Clearwater promptly&mdash;too
promptly.</p>

<p>But long before Helm and his campaign
reached Harrison there were other reasons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
why the Hollisters, indeed all the &#8220;best
people,&#8221; could not show themselves at a
Helm meeting.</p>

<p>The ignorance of the mass of mankind
has made government an arrangement
whereunder the many labor for the prosperity
of the few. The pretexts for this
scheme and the devices for carrying it out
have varied; but the scheme itself has not
varied&mdash;and will not vary until the night of
ignorance and the fog of prejudice shall
have been rolled away. All things considered,
it is most creditable to human nature
and most significant of the moral power of
enlightenment, that the intelligent few have
dealt so moderately with their benighted
fellows and have worked so industriously
to end their own domination by teaching
their servitors the way of emancipation;
for let it not be forgotten that the light
comes only from above, that the man who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
has emancipated himself could always, if
he chose, be oppressor. Our modern American
version of this ancient scheme of the
few exploiting the many consists of two
essential parts&mdash;laws cunningly designed to
enable the few to establish their toll gates
upon every road of labor; courts shrewdly
officered so that the judges can, if they will,
issue the licenses for the aforesaid toll
gates, which are not as a rule established,
but simply permitted, by the law. The
treacherous legislator enacts the slyly
worded authorization; the subservient
judge&mdash;no, rather, the judge chosen from,
and in sympathy with, the dominant class&mdash;reads
the permissive statute as mandatory.</p>

<p>This primer lesson in politics, known to
all men who have opportunity to learn and
who see fit to seize the opportunity, was of
course known to George Helm. But he did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
not content himself with a dry, tiresome,
&#8220;courteous&#8221; statement of the fact. He
brought it home to the people of those three
counties by showing precisely what Judge
Powers had done in his seven years as the
people&#8217;s high officer of justice&mdash;by relating
in detail the favors he had granted to the
railways, both steam and trolley, to the
monopolies in every necessity of life. He
also gave an account of Judge Powers&#8217;s
material prosperity, his rapid rise to riches
in those seven years, and the flourishing
condition of his relatives and intimate
friends, the men owning stock in the railway
and other monopolies. In a word, the
young candidate made what is known as
a &#8220;blatherskite&#8221; campaign. In his youth
and simplicity he imagined that, as a candidate,
it was his duty to tell the truth to the
people. He did not know the difference
between the two kinds of truth&mdash;decent and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
indecent&mdash;decent truth that gives everybody
a comfortable sense of general depravity,
and indecent truth that points out specific
instances of depravity, giving names,
dates and places.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let those who will benefit by Judge
Powers&#8217;s notion of justice and law vote for
him,&#8221; said Helm. &#8220;I ask those who will
benefit by my notion of law and justice to
vote for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Democratic machine hastened to disavow
Helm&#8217;s plainness of speech. The
newspapers, Democratic no less than Republican,
ignored him. But the scandal
would not down. The news of Helm&#8217;s
charges&mdash;of his unparliamentary statements
of fact&mdash;spread from village to village,
from farm to farm. Within a week it was
no longer necessary for him to distribute
handbills and call at farm-houses to announce
his meetings. Wherever he went he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
found a crowd waiting to hear his simple
conversational appeal to common-sense&mdash;and,
after hearing, bursting into cheers. In
private, in handshaking and talking with
the farmers and villagers, he was all humor,
full of homely, witty stories and jests. But
the moment he stood up as the candidate
addressing the people, the face lost its
humor lines, the eyes their twinkle, and he
uttered one plain, serious sentence after another,
each making a point against Judge
Powers.</p>

<p>The strong homely face grew rapidly
thinner. The deep-set gray eyes sank still
deeper beneath the overhanging brows. As
for the frock suit, it soon became a wretched
exhibit from a rag bag. The &#8220;respectable&#8221;
people&mdash;that is, those owning the stocks
and bonds of Judge Powers&#8217;s prot&eacute;g&eacute; companies&mdash;laughed
at the fantastic figure,
roving about in the mud-stained buggy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
But&mdash;&#8220;the common people heard him
gladly.&#8221;</p>

<p>After six weeks of campaigning with
farmers and villagers, Helm felt strong
enough to attack the fortress&mdash;Harrison.
There are those in Harrison who can
still tell in minutest detail of the coming
of Helm&mdash;driving slowly, toward mid-day,
down the main street&mdash;the direct
way to Mrs. Beaver&#8217;s boarding-house. The
top hat was furry and dusty. The black
frock suit was streaked and stained, was
wrinkled and mussed. The big shoulders
drooped wearily. But the powerful
head was calmly erect, and there was
might in the great, toil-scarred hands
that held the reins on the high bony
knees.</p>

<p>Not in the worst days of the whiskers
had George Helm been so ludicrous to look
at. But no one laughed. The crowds along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the sidewalks gazed in silence and awe. A
<i>man</i> had come to town.</p>

<p>That afternoon he spoke in Court House
square&mdash;that afternoon, and again after
supper, and twice every day for a week.
Never had there been such crowds
at political meetings&mdash;and, toward the
last, never such enthusiasm. The suddenness,
the strangeness of the attack
paralyzed the opposition. It accepted
Judge Powers&#8217;s dignified suggestion&mdash;&#8220;the
fellow is beneath contempt, is unworthy of
notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the end of the week, off went George
to the sparser regions again, repeating the
queer triumph of his first tour. And every
one was asking every one else, What are the
people going to do? Reichman, the Republican
boss, put this question to Democratic
boss Branagan when they met a few evenings
before the election on the neutral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
ground of Tom Duffy&#8217;s saloon and oyster
parlor.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think the people are going
to do?&#8221; asked Reichman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dun&#8217; no,&#8221; said Branagan. &#8220;But I know
what <i>I&#8217;m</i> goin&#8217; to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>This, with a wicked grin and a wink.
Said Reichman, &#8220;Me, too, Pat.&#8221;</p>

<p>And they did it. Not a difficult thing to
do at any election, for the people know little
about election machinery, and do not watch&mdash;indeed,
what would the poor blind, ignorant
creatures find out if they did watch?
Yes, Reichman and his Democratic partner
did it. The easiest thing in the world, when
the machinery of both parties is in the same
hands.</p>

<p>The country went strongly for Helm.
But Harrison and the three other towns of
the district more than &#8220;saved the day for
the sanctity of the ermine and the politics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
of gentlemen.&#8221; Judge Powers was re&euml;lected
by an only slightly reduced plurality.
Helm had polled three times as many
votes as any Democratic candidate ever had.
But the famous &#8220;silent, stay-at-home voter&#8221;
had come forth and had saved the republic.
That famous retiring patriot!&mdash;so retiring
that the census men cannot find him and
the undertaker never buries him. But no
matter. He is our greatest patriot. He
always appears when his country needs him.</p>

<p>No one saw Helm on election night. At
Mrs. Beaver&#8217;s it was said that he had gone
to bed at the usual time. Next day he appeared,
looking much as usual. The gray
eyes were twinkling; the humorous lines
round the mouth were ready for action. He
went to see Branagan at the saloon. They
sat down to a friendly glass of beer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Helm,&#8221; said Branagan, &#8220;you
lost.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>&#8220;The election&mdash;yes,&#8221; said Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything,&#8221; said Branagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; replied George softly. &#8220;Next
time I may win.&#8221;</p>

<p>Branagan&#8217;s hard blue eyes looked straight
into Helm&#8217;s. Said he: &#8220;There ain&#8217;t goin&#8217;
to be no next time&mdash;fur you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm returned the gaze. &#8220;Yes, there is,
Pat,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Goin&#8217; to make a livin&#8217;, practicin&#8217; before
Judge Powers&mdash;eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m going up the State to teach
school. But I&#8217;m coming back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;hell,&#8221; said Pat Branagan&mdash;a jeer,
but an ill-tempered one.</p>

<p>On his way uptown again George Helm
almost walked into Eleanor Clearwater and
Clara Hollister. He lifted his hat and
bowed, blushing deeply. The two girls
looked past him. Clara seemed unconscious
that he was there; Eleanor slightly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
inclined her head&mdash;a cold, polite acknowledgment
of the salute of a mistaken stranger.</p>

<p>Helm put on the frayed and frowzled top
hat. His embarrassment left him. With a
sweet and simple smile of apology that
made the strong homely face superbly
proud, he strode erectly on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II<br />


<small>THE CAT&#8217;S-PAW</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">PAT BRANAGAN, Democratic boss
of Harrison, had said to George
Helm, his defeated nominee for
circuit judge: &#8220;There ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to be no
next time&mdash;fur you.&#8221; He had said this in
circumstances of extreme provocation. The
young candidate, nominated as a joke, nominated
to help the Republican machine roll
up a &#8220;monumental majority&#8221; for Judge
Powers, judicial agent of the interests owning
both party machines&mdash;the young candidate
had made a house to house, stump to
stump campaign, had exposed Judge Powers,
had forced both machines to commit
wholesale election frauds to prevent his defeat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
But Mr. Branagan&#8217;s anger had not
been the real cause of his serving notice on
the big, homely young lawyer that he would
never get another nomination from the
Democratic party of the city of Harrison.
Mr. Branagan did not conduct his life with
his temper. If he had done so, he would
not have become boss, but would have remained
a crumb-fed private. He had reasons&mdash;reasons
of sound business sense&mdash;for
&#8220;double crossing&#8221; George Helm. The
Helm sort of Democrat, attacking corruption,
smashing at the Republican machine,
rousing the people to suspect and to reflect
and to revolt, was a dangerous menace to
the Branagan income.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s one of them there damned agitators
that&#8217;s bad for business,&#8221; said Mr. Branagan
to his friend and partner, the Republican
boss. &#8220;Everything&#8217;s running quiet
and smooth here, and the people&#8217;s satisfied.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
If that fellow had his way, they&#8217;d be attendin&#8217;
to politics instead of to their jobs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Reichman. &#8220;My
people&#8221;&mdash;meaning the corporations whose
political agent he was&mdash;&#8220;my people understand
you didn&#8217;t intend to do it. They look
to you to get rid of him.&#8221; Reichman said
&#8220;my people&#8221; rather than &#8220;your people,&#8221;
because Republican partisans being overwhelmingly
in the majority in that district,
the interests had him for chief political
manager, and dealt with the Democratic
boss only through him. If Reichman had
been strictly accurate he would not have
said &#8220;my people,&#8221; but &#8220;<i>the</i> people&#8221;; for
the interests are the only people who have
not power in politics.</p>

<p>&#8220;Helm&#8217;s leaving, all right,&#8221; said Branagan.
&#8220;That there campaign of his used up
his money. He never had no law business,
and he&#8217;s smart enough to know he&#8217;ll never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
get none hereabouts, so long as Powers is
on the bench. So he&#8217;s gone up the State
to teach school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the last of <i>him</i>,&#8221; said Reichman.
&#8220;I&#8217;m kind of sorry for him, Pat.
He&#8217;s a damn nice young fellow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and a mighty good stumper, too.&#8221;
With a grin, &#8220;He landed on your friend the
Judge&mdash;jaw, solar plexus, kidneys&mdash;had
him groggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two bosses laughed uproariously.
Then Branagan said: &#8220;Yes, George Helm&#8217;s
a nice boy. But I don&#8217;t like him. If he&#8217;d
a won out, he&#8217;d a made it hot for me&mdash;and
for you, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Reichman. &#8220;And
he&#8217;s all in. I can think well of the dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like him,&#8221; growled Branagan.
&#8220;He fooled me with those crazy red whiskers
of his. I knew what he was the first
time I saw him after he cut &#8217;em off&mdash;that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
was the day after I put him on the
ticket. When a man fools me, he makes me
mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He fooled everybody,&#8221; said Reichman
soothingly. &#8220;And as it has turned out
there&#8217;s no harm done. The way we made
him walk the plank&#8217;ll be a warning to any
other young smart Alecks there are in these
parts, thinking of upsetting things.&#8221;</p>

<p>It certainly looked as if George Helm
were dead and done for in that community.
But Patrick Branagan was a sensible man.
Vain men concern themselves about likes
and dislikes; sensible men, about advantages
and disadvantages. It came to pass
in that winter, while George Helm was
teaching school up the State, and saving
money for another attempt as a lawyer,
Branagan and Reichman fell out about the
division of the graft. Branagan was a slow
thinker, but it gradually penetrated to him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
that in George Helm he had a threat
wherewith he could, or, rather, should, extort
for himself a larger share of the spoils.
Helm, making a single-handed campaign
against both machines&mdash;for the Branagan
machine had repudiated him&mdash;had carried
the district, had been kept out of office only
by the most barefaced frauds in Harrison
and the three large towns. So Branagan
told Reichman that unless his share&mdash;in the
vice money, in the &#8220;campaign contributions&#8221;
and in the contracts&mdash;were raised to
an equality with Reichman&#8217;s own share,
he would bring Helm back. Reichman
laughed, Branagan insisted. Reichman
grew insulting. Branagan presented an
ultimatum. Reichman answered by cutting
Branagan&#8217;s third to a fourth.</p>

<p>In May Branagan went up to Mrs. Beaver&#8217;s
boarding-house. Yes, Mr. Helm had
left his address. &#8220;And,&#8221; said Mrs. Beaver,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
&#8220;he sends me regular his rent for the room
he had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he do that for?&#8221; said Branagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Mrs. Beaver.
&#8220;He was mighty queer in lots of ways. No,
I can&#8217;t nohow work it out why he sends me
the two dollars a week&mdash;and him so poor he
had to do his own washing and mending&mdash;and
wore celluloid.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Branagan knew, on second thought.
So the young damn fool did intend to come
back&mdash;had kept his legal residence in Harrison.
Though this news was altogether
satisfactory to Branagan&#8217;s plans, it gave him
a qualm. What a stubborn, <i>dangerous</i> chap
this boy was! However&mdash;his fear of Helm
was vague and remote, his need of him
clear and near. He took the midnight express
for the north and was at George
Helm&#8217;s boarding-house on the lake front at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Saskaween as George, with breakfast finished
and his cigar lighted, was starting out
for a stroll.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go along,&#8221; said Pat. &#8220;Throw away
that cigar and let me give you a good one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s like the one you&#8217;re smoking,&#8221; said
George, &#8220;it&#8217;s not good. But it&#8217;s better than
my five-center.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I pay a quarter apiece for my cigars,&#8221;
said Branagan. &#8220;And I think I know a
good cigar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think it&#8217;s good because Len Melcher
charges you a quarter for it,&#8221; replied
Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know about good cigars,
anyhow?&#8221; said Branagan, ruffled that this
poor school teacher should presume to be
critical.</p>

<p>Helm might have explained that he happened
to be one of those people who are
born with intensely acute senses&mdash;eyes that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
see, ears that hear, nerves of touch, taste
and smell that respond where the ordinary
nerve remains inert. But he contented himself
with a good-natured laugh and a cheerful,
&#8220;Where&#8217;s the cigar? And what do you
want, Pat?&#8221;</p>

<p>Branagan drew the cigar from his well-filled
waistcoat pocket. &#8220;How&#8217;d you like
to go to the State Legislature next winter,
as Senator from down yonder?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Helm lit the quarter cigar from his
&#8220;five-center,&#8221; strode along in silence beside
his shorter and stouter companion. He finally said:</p>

<p>&#8220;So you and Reichman have fallen out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Personally, we&#8217;re friends,&#8221; replied the
Democratic boss with an air of virtue earnest
enough, but so grotesque that it did not
even seem hypocritical. &#8220;But in politics
we are and always have been enemies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm&#8217;s deep-set gray eyes gazed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
shrewdly at the heavy red face of the boss.
&#8220;And,&#8221; he went on, as if Branagan had not
spoken, &#8220;you want to use me as a club for
bringing him to terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s been handing you out that line
of dope?&#8221; said Branagan noisily.</p>

<p>Helm ignored this blustering bluff as unworthy
of reply. He said: &#8220;When do you
want your answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t offered you no nomination,&#8221; protested
Branagan angrily. &#8220;I just put out
a suggestion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;you want to make terms?&mdash;want to
pledge me?&mdash;want to see if you can control
me?&#8221; Helm shook his head and smiled.
&#8220;Nothing doing, Pat,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, look here, George&mdash;why&#8217;re you so
damn suspicious? I&#8217;m older&#8217;n you and I&#8217;ve
been all through the game. Let me tell
you, my boy, you&#8217;re trying to get in the
wrong way. There&#8217;s nothing in that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
end of the game. A fellow who works for
the people works for somebody that&#8217;s got
nothing, and is a fool, to boot. Get in
right, George. Work for them as can and
will do something for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not thinking of working for the
people,&#8221; replied Helm, amused. &#8220;I&#8217;m
working for myself&mdash;for my own amusement.
I&#8217;ve made up my mind to have a
good time in my life&mdash;not what <i>you&#8217;d</i> call
a good time, perhaps, but the kind of a time
that suits me. I don&#8217;t care for money&mdash;nor
for the things money buys. I rather
think the kind of woman I&#8217;d want wouldn&#8217;t
want me&mdash;so I&#8217;m not going to have a
wife and family to work for. I&#8217;ve decided
to be my own boss&mdash;and to do as I
damn please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a queer chap, for sure,&#8221; said
Branagan. &#8220;But let me tell you one thing.
A man that sets out to do as he pleases has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
got to have a lot of money&mdash;unless he
pleases to be a hobo, or near it. You&#8217;d
better wait till you&#8217;ve made your pile before
you put your nose in the air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of that,&#8221; said Helm. &#8220;Yes,
I&#8217;ve got to have money. They can always
do me up as long as I&#8217;m poor. But I&#8217;m
going to make it in my own way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> can help you,&#8221; said Branagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;you could,&#8221; admitted Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d not have to touch a cent that
wasn&#8217;t perfectly honest graft.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the joke?&#8221; demanded Branagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking how plainly you were
showing me your hand. How you must
need me to travel clear across the State to
see me, and then to talk straight out like
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Branagan frowned&mdash;grinned. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
need you any more than you need me,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
retorted he. &#8220;Not as bad. How much does
this job you&#8217;ve got pay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixty-five a month.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you an educated man. That
was a pretty good hash house you&#8217;re livin&#8217;
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fourth rate. But my bed&#8217;s clean and
the food is good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sixty-five a month! I can put you in
the way of makin&#8217; that much a day&mdash;if you
deliver the goods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meaning&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you carry in my ticket next fall&mdash;and
behave yourself like a sensible man after
you get in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was my majority in the district
last fall?&#8221; Helm suddenly asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;About twelve hundred,&#8221; replied Branagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; said Helm. &#8220;If I&#8217;d had
five thousand dollars I&#8217;d have sent you and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
Reichman to the pen for the frauds. But
you knew I&#8217;d be helpless.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Democratic boss gave him an amiable
and sympathetic look. Said he: &#8220;A
man without money is always helpless,
George. And the further he goes the surer
he is to fall&mdash;and fall hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. I&#8217;ve got to have enough to
make me independent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;re you goin&#8217; to get it, my boy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been trying to figure
out,&#8221; confessed Helm. &#8220;Thus far I&#8217;ve not
found the answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never find it where you&#8217;re looking,&#8221;
said Branagan. &#8220;The people&mdash;they
ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to give it to you. And you ain&#8217;t
goin&#8217; to get no law cases unless you&#8217;re in
right. If you did get a good law case, it&#8217;d
be decided against you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm&#8217;s expression was admission that the
boss was right.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>&#8220;And,&#8221; proceeded Branagan, &#8220;if you decided
to make money by going into business&mdash;that&#8217;s
slow, and anyhow you&#8217;ll have to
graft or you won&#8217;t make nothin&#8217;. I tell you,
George&mdash;&mdash; They call us politicians grafters.
But the truth is we&#8217;re a damn sight
honester than the business men or the lawyers&mdash;or
any other class except them that
ain&#8217;t got no chance to graft. The worst of
us ain&#8217;t no worse than the best of them
swell, big-figger grafters like Hollister and
Powers. And the best of us is a hell of a
sight honester. <i>We&#8217;ve</i> got some friendship
in us. And I&#8217;ve yet to see the respectable,
tony, church-going grafter I&#8217;d trust unless
I had him in writing. What&#8217;s the matter
nowadays with Al Reichman? Why, as
long as he was just a plain low-down politician
he kept his word and played square.
But now that he&#8217;s married among the swells
and has taken up the respectable end of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
game, he&#8217;s as crooked as&mdash;as Judge Powers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t make up my mind what to do
about Reichman,&#8221; said Branagan to Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you got your orders from the
crowd that&#8217;s behind both of you?&#8221; inquired
Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;to let him alone&mdash;to let up on
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; Branagan reluctantly admitted.
&#8220;I wisht I was as young as you,
George&mdash;and had my old-time nerve&mdash;and
didn&#8217;t have an expensive family. I&#8217;d take
a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of being able to stay in now that you&#8217;re
in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it. Damn it, I sometimes believe
we could.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm shook his head. &#8220;The district is
normally seven thousand Republicans out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
of a total vote of eighteen thousand. It&#8217;d
take ten years of hard work&mdash;and <i>honest</i>
politics&mdash;to change that round to a small
<i>steady</i> Democratic plurality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the people are crazy about <i>you</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t re&euml;lect me,&#8221; said Helm.
&#8220;Next time they&#8217;ll be back in the harness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a youngster you take a mighty
gloomy view of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t delude myself. I don&#8217;t dare.
I&#8217;ve been making my own living since I was
ten and I&#8217;ve got to go on making it till I
die.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the people are mutts,&#8221; said Branagan.
&#8220;They were born to be trimmed.....
So&mdash;if you was in my place you&#8217;d fix up a
peace with Reichman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Helm. &#8220;<i>I</i> shouldn&#8217;t. But
<i>you</i> ought to do it. You don&#8217;t want to make
a losing fight for ten years&mdash;do you? You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
don&#8217;t want to drop politics as a business, do
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a business or it&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; replied
Branagan.</p>

<p>&#8220;For you,&#8221; corrected Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;For all of them that&#8217;s in it&mdash;except here
and there a crank.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except here and there a crank,&#8221; assented
Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Republicans and Democrats&mdash;they all
belong one way or another to this interest
or that. What&#8217;s the use of fighting the
crowd that&#8217;s got the money? No use&mdash;not
here in this town&mdash;not up to the State Capitol,
where you&#8217;re going&mdash;not on to Washington
where I reckon you calculate to go
some day. Not nowhere, George!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not nowhere,&#8221; said George. &#8220;It takes
two negatives to give that affirmative its
full strength.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not nowhere on earth,&#8221; repeated Branagan.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
&#8220;Fight the money crowd, and sooner
or later they&#8217;ll get you down. Bluff at
fightin&#8217; &#8217;em. They don&#8217;t mind that. They
understand you&#8217;ve got to keep in with the
people, and they want you to, so as you&#8217;ll
be useful. But don&#8217;t <i>do</i> nothing. Look at
any of the big politicians that the people
think so well of. What have they <i>done</i>?
Nothing. They&#8217;ve bluffed&mdash;and talked&mdash;and
roared. Maybe they cut off a measly
little grafter here or there. But when it
came to a show-down, they gave the crowd
with the cash what they wanted. Eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;what are <i>you</i> going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see when the time comes. Meantime,
what&#8217;s my cue, Pat? To roar&mdash;isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Branagan laughed. &#8220;And you&#8217;re the boy
that can do it,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You almost
make <i>me</i> believe you&#8217;re in earnest.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>Helm gave his political sponsor a queer,
quick look. &#8220;Almost,&#8221; he said, with a
laugh. &#8220;That&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For your age, Helm, you&#8217;ve got the best
nut on you of any man I know or know
about. I&#8217;ll back you to win. You&#8217;ll be the
nominee for governor in two years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;And as soon as I settle things with
Reichman I&#8217;ll give you all the law business
you can take care of&mdash;good, paying business&mdash;the
kind that won&#8217;t hurt you with the
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take all of that I can get,&#8221; said
Helm. &#8220;I want to make money. I&#8217;ve <i>got</i>
to make money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve put me in the way of doing better
than ever, my boy, and I&#8217;m not ungrateful.&#8221;</p>

<p>George winced. But he laughed and
said: &#8220;And don&#8217;t forget, my usefulness has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
only begun.&#8221; He reflected, smiled a peculiar
secret smile as he went on: &#8220;The
people allow the crowd that&#8217;s robbing them
to pay big wages to the politicians who
make the robbery possible. Why shouldn&#8217;t
an honest man take away from the robbers
a big enough share to keep him going and
to put him in a position to serve the people
better?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good sense,&#8221; said Branagan
heartily.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s practical,&#8221; said Helm, staring
gloomily.</p>

<p>Branagan observed him with narrowed
eyelids and cigar tilted to a high reflective
angle. &#8220;You&#8217;re a queer one,&#8221; he said, at
last. &#8220;I can&#8217;t exactly place you.&#8221;</p>

<p>From time to time Helm had been nodding
a thoughtful assent. He now said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Last summer and fall I got a lot of
experience, Branagan. Ever since, I&#8217;ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
been turning it over in my mind. The time
may come when a man can get where he
wants to go by a smooth bee line through
the air. But not now. Now he has to
move along the ground, and the road isn&#8217;t
as straight as it might be, or as smooth. I
was all for the bee line through the air.
I&#8217;ve found out better.&#8221; He looked pointedly
at his hard-eyed companion. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t changed my <i>destination</i>, Pat. You
understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>Branagan nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve simply changed from the heavenly
route to the human. And by human I don&#8217;t
mean crooked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand, Mr. Helm,&#8221; said Branagan,
with the respect a shrewd man cannot
but feel in presence of an intelligence that
has shown itself the superior of his. &#8220;I
understand perfectly, George.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You probably don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
George. &#8220;But no matter. You can be boss
of the machine, but you can&#8217;t be my boss.
If you give me the nomination and I&#8217;m
elected, I&#8217;ll not attack the&mdash;the shortcomings
of my friends until I&#8217;ve settled with
the crimes of my enemies. I&#8217;ll not forget
that I owe you, and not the people, for the
nomination. But neither will I forget that
I owe the people, and not you, for the election.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk, Helm!&#8221; said Branagan,
with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll accept your nomination <i>if</i> you make
up a good ticket throughout&mdash;one that
ought to win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to do that, George,&#8221; said the
boss. &#8220;The Republicans outnumber us
three to one. Yes, I&#8217;ll give you A1 running
mates.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After we&#8217;ve won&mdash;you&#8217;ll have to look
out for yourself,&#8221; pursued Helm. &#8220;I&#8217;ll not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
stand <i>personally</i> for any crookedness. I
don&#8217;t like it, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s good
politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll nominate you,&#8221; said Branagan.
&#8220;And I&#8217;ll send you a list of the men I pick
out to run with you. I&#8217;m not a fool, Mr.
Helm. I know we can&#8217;t get in unless we
make the people believe we&#8217;re sincere&mdash;and
that we can&#8217;t make &#8217;em believe it unless we
put up clean men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm smiled. &#8220;Yes&mdash;we&#8217;ve got to make
a good strong bluff at decency.&#8221;</p>

<p>Branagan inspected Helm&#8217;s face with a
quick, eager glance&mdash;a hopeful glance.
Helm laughed at him. Branagan colored.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you didn&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said
Helm. &#8220;But, as I said before, it doesn&#8217;t
matter. We&#8217;ll only win the one election.
Then the people&#8217;ll go back to their Republican
rut, and in will come Reichman and
the old gang again. You calculate that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
can make better terms with him after you&#8217;ve
given him a beating. Now, don&#8217;t you see
that it&#8217;s to your interest to keep me decent&mdash;to
keep me a scarecrow for Reichman?&#8221;</p>

<p>Branagan nodded. &#8220;You and me&#8217;ll have
no trouble, George. I&#8217;ll let you play your
game to suit yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two months later Helm reappeared at
Harrison, resumed the lodging at Mrs.
Beaver&#8217;s and the dark and dingy little back
office in the Masonic Temple. He was
dressed in new clothes&mdash;a plain, cheap business
suit of dark blue, linen shirt, collars
and cuffs, a straw hat. He thought himself
a stylish, almost a foppish, person. In fact
he seemed hardly less unkempt and ill fitted
than he had in the black frock suit and top
hat of the previous year. Perhaps&mdash;but
only perhaps&mdash;in the days of the toga
George Helm might have looked well in
clothes; in modern dress he could not look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
well. The most he could do was to look
clean and important and strong&mdash;and that
he certainly did.</p>

<p>Reichman understood, the moment it
became known that the young lawyer had
as clients four contracting companies in
which Pat Branagan was the silent&mdash;and
sole&mdash;partner. Reichman was for making
a fight at once. But Judge Powers and
Hollister had no fancy for a shower of the
shafts which would glance harmlessly from
the tough hide of Reichman, but would
penetrate their skins and fester in their
vanity. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of Helm,&#8221; said Hollister.
And he sent his son Bart to call.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to see you back,&#8221; said Barton, a
dazzling but also an agreeable apparition
in the dingy dimness of Helm&#8217;s office. &#8220;We
were talking about you only yesterday&mdash;I
and my sister and Miss Clearwater. You
remember her?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I&mdash;I remember her,&#8221; said Helm,
as painfully embarrassed as if Miss Eleanor
Clearwater, the beautiful, the fashionable,
had been there in her own exquisite person.
Remember her! Not a day had passed that
he had not lived again those hours when
chances had thrown him into her company
on terms of almost friendly intimacy.</p>

<p>&#8220;We want you to come to dinner,&#8221; continued
Barton, pretending not to notice the
simple, uncouth, homely Helm&#8217;s woeful
confusion. &#8220;To-morrow night&mdash;very informal&mdash;dressed
as you are&mdash;really a home
supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry, but I can&#8217;t,&#8221; George blurted out&mdash;curt,
rude, uncouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;nonsense!&#8221; cried young Hollister.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll get along all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t come, Mr. Hollister,&#8221; said
George, suddenly recovering his self-possession.
Perhaps the fashionable young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
man&#8217;s misunderstanding of his diffidence
may have helped. Helm went on with the
natural dignity and grace that makes the
acquired sort look what it is, &#8220;It&#8217;s very kind
of your father and Judge Powers to ask me.
But I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>I&#8217;m</i> asking you,&#8221; weakly blustered Barton.
&#8220;My father&#8217;s got nothing to do with
it. As for Judge Powers, I can&#8217;t see why
you drag <i>him</i> in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The calm, honest look of George Helm&#8217;s
deep-set eyes was not easy to bear, as he
explained without a trace of anger:</p>

<p>&#8220;I met your sister and her friend on the
street the day after the election last fall.
They made it plain that they had ceased to
know me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; interrupted Bart, &#8220;that was the
day after the election, when everybody was
hot in the collar. We&#8217;ve all cooled down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come back here to go into politics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
again,&#8221; said George. &#8220;And I&#8217;ve got to say
and do things that&#8217;ll make you and your
relatives madder than ever&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221; cried Bart. &#8220;I say, Helm,
what&#8217;s the use of being so devilish personal
and unpleasant? Why stir things up and
make trouble for yourself? Why not join
our party and jog along quietly and comfortably?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm laughed good-humoredly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
say it&#8217;s because I was born a contentious
cuss and can&#8217;t change my nature. No, Hollister&mdash;you
don&#8217;t want me at your house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hollister was convinced. But his father&#8217;s
orders had been positive, had made no provision
for failure. He persisted as best he
could: &#8220;You can&#8217;t think we&#8217;re trying to
buy you with a dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;m too good-natured not to sell
out for a dinner&mdash;and that sort of thing&mdash;if
I put myself in the way of temptation.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>&#8220;What rot! You&#8217;ll come? Nell Clearwater
will be terribly disappointed. She
took quite a shine to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>George Helm laughed. &#8220;I shave myself,
Hollister. I see myself every morning.
I&#8217;m not for the ladies, nor they for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hell! A woman doesn&#8217;t care what
a man looks like. They&#8217;d rather a man
wouldn&#8217;t be handsome, so he&#8217;ll think about
them instead of about himself. The way to
please a woman is to help her to think of
nothing but herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a ladies&#8217; man,&#8221; said Helm.</p>

<p>Hollister argued&mdash;not unskillfully, because
he liked Helm. But George was not
to be moved. He had not set out from the
depth of the valleys for the heights without
so obvious a precaution as taking the measure
of his weaknesses. He knew that the
one bribe he could not resist was the social
bribe&mdash;that his one chance for success in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
career he had mapped out for himself lay
in having no friends among those he must
fight. And in the nearest rank of them
were Hollister, the railway giant of the
State, and Judge Powers, his brother-in-law
and closest judicial agent. A day or so
later, when he, walking up Main Street,
saw Clara Hollister and Eleanor Clearwater
driving toward him in a phaeton, he
abruptly turned to inspect a window display.
He shivered and jumped ridiculously
when he heard Clara&#8217;s voice at his
elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> interested in <i>millinery</i>!&#8221; Miss Hollister
was saying laughingly.</p>

<p>He noted with a wild glance that he had
stopped before a show window full of women&#8217;s
hats. &#8220;How d&#8217;ye do, Miss Powers,&#8221;
he stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hollister,&#8221; she corrected. &#8220;Judge Powers
is my <i>uncle</i>.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>Helm&#8217;s confusion became a rout. &#8220;I&mdash;I
beg&mdash;your pardon,&#8221; he said, dropping his
hat and a law book he was carrying. In
picking them up he slipped, and with
difficulty saved his long, loose frame
from sprawling upon the sidewalk. But
as he straightened up, by one of those sudden
inward revolutions, he became cool
and self-possessed. He burst out laughing
at himself&mdash;and when he laughed
his fine eyes and his really splendid teeth
made him handsome&mdash;for a homely
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please talk to Nell Clearwater while
I&#8217;m in here,&#8221; said Clara, leaving him with
a nod and a smile to flit in at the open door
of the shop.</p>

<p>Helm advanced to the curb where the
phaeton was drawn up. One glance at
Miss Clearwater&#8217;s cold and reserved face
was enough to convince him that she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
an unwilling party to Clara Hollister&#8217;s plot.
He said, with a simple, direct frankness:</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t quite fair&mdash;is it?&mdash;to blame me.
I certainly tried to avoid you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their glances met. She could not resist
the kindly humorous twinkle in his eyes.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to see you again,&#8221; said she, polite,
if not cordial. Her hand hesitated,
moved to extend, settled itself again beside
the hand holding the reins. &#8220;You&#8217;re back
to stay?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; His hand rose toward his hat for
the leave-taking.</p>

<p>&#8220;In politics?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her look was coldly disdainful. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
wish you success,&#8221; she said, with a slight
nod of dismissal.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not to your credit,&#8221; replied he,
with quiet dignity.</p>

<p>She flushed. &#8220;You know that you yourself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
are ashamed of what you are doing,&#8221;
said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were ashamed to come to Mr. Hollister&#8217;s
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had two reasons for not going there,&#8221;
said Helm. &#8220;Neither of them was shame&mdash;or
anything like it. Mr. Hollister may be
ashamed. He certainly is afraid. But I
am not. They wished to bribe me to silence
by flattering me with their friendship. I
refused to be bribed. That was one of my
reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he said it in that way of simple sincerity
which made him convincing, both
in private life and on the platform, she
accepted his statement as the truth. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know much about business and politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you know enough to suspect I may
be right,&#8221; replied he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>&#8220;My sympathies are with my own class,&#8221;
said she, rather coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And mine are, naturally, with my class,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>There was no ostentation in his reply.
But somehow Nell Clearwater felt not quite
so well content with her &#8220;class&#8221;&mdash;or with
her claim to it. That personal claim now
seemed distinctly vulgar in contrast with
his dignity. She said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What was your other reason for not
coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>He gazed directly at her. &#8220;Why should
I tell it when you know already?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she colored. &#8220;You are impertinent,&#8221;
said she haughtily. Then the color
flamed, for she instantly realized how she
had trapped herself.</p>

<p>He laughed with engaging gentleness.
&#8220;Not impertinent,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;Not presuming,
even.... I don&#8217;t want you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
Miss Clearwater. I stay away simply because
I don&#8217;t intend to allow myself to want
you.&#8221; Into his gray eyes came a look that
no woman could fail to understand. &#8220;If I
did want you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He smiled, and she
drew back sharply&mdash;&#8220;If I did want you, I&#8217;d
act very differently.&#8221;</p>

<p>She forced a scornful laugh. &#8220;Do you
think <i>you</i> could possibly have any hope
with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; was his firm reply. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
until to-day. Now I&mdash;know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What vanity!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Not vanity. Intuition. The fact
that you brought the subject up and insisted
on discussing it proves that you have
thought about it seriously.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221; exclaimed she, with angry
irony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; replied he&mdash;and she refused to
meet his gaze. &#8220;Not as much as I have,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
because you have more of that sort of things
in your life than I have in mine. No, not
nearly as much. But seriously. And because
you are truthful you will not deny it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She repeated the slight derisive laugh.
She accompanied it with a derisive glance
that swept down and up his baggy clothing,
his homely exterior&mdash;but avoided his kind,
gently smiling gray eyes. He was not deceived.
It set his blood to tingling to feel
that he could weave about one person, this
one person, the same spell with which he
could bind the multitude. He went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Working together at that broken automobile
we got unusually well acquainted,
very quickly&mdash;you and I&mdash;the real you and
the real I.... I had never before
met a woman of your kind&mdash;of your class,
I suppose you&#8217;d say. And neither had you
ever met a man of my kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;that was it,&#8221; she said unsteadily.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>&#8220;But, as I said before, I do not want
you,&#8221; he went on and, hearing, you would
have realized why he had such power as an
orator. &#8220;Even if I could get you, I should
not know what to do with you. So&mdash;if we
ever talk together again, it will not be
through my seeking.&#8221;</p>

<p>He bowed with dignity and grace&mdash;for,
whenever he was unconscious of himself&mdash;on
the platform or when absorbed in
earnest conversation&mdash;his awkwardness
dropped from him, revealing his homeliness
as attractive. He went on uptown,
dazed, wondering at himself, doubting
whether he was awake. Had he indeed
seen Eleanor Clearwater? Had they said
to each other the things he was amazedly
recalling? Awe of male externals of ornamentation
and pretense he had never felt.
But his awe for fashion and manner in
women had been deep and painful&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
reverent. What had become of this? Certainly
no other woman he had known, or
for that matter seen, possessed the awe-inspiring
qualities to such a degree as this
woman. Ever since that night of toil with
the automobile he had been idealizing and
worshiping her as the embodiment of
woman, the paradise from which he was
forever barred. Yet, alone with her for
the first time, and in circumstances which
ought to have made him speechless, he had
disregarded her disdain, had smiled at her
scorn, had spoken his heart to her as he had
never ventured to speak it to himself in the
privacy and the ecstasy of his secret
dreams! &#8220;I guess I <i>am</i> a queer chap,&#8221; he
said to himself. &#8220;I&#8217;m always giving myself
surprises. I never know what I&#8217;ll do
next.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is an excellent thing for a modest man
of real merit to discover that he has unsuspected<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
resources of steady courage. It
was an excellent thing for George Helm.
From that day he took on a new dignity
and assurance&mdash;created about himself the
atmosphere that inspires men to confidence
in their leaders. He changed the liking of
his followers into that passionate loyalty
which is the great force in the world of action.
For most men cannot reason and
judge; they must choose a party and a
leader by instinct and must trust themselves
to that party and that leader implicitly.
The story of history is the story of loyalty&mdash;and
of loyalty betrayed. The mass
has trusted and worshiped a class; the class
has become infatuated with itself, has trampled
on and betrayed the mass.</p>

<p>George Helm had won, the previous fall,
because the mass of the people in that district
had at last become more than suspicious
of the honesty and fidelity of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
chosen leaders. He had come at just the
right time. And he now won again&mdash;an
overwhelming victory that could not be
reversed by election frauds, with Branagan
no longer assenting and assisting&mdash;a victory
that frightened Reichman not only for
his damaged machine but also for his personal
safety; for, a Democratic county prosecutor,
a subtle henchman of Branagan&#8217;s,
had been elected along with Helm, and
Reichman knew that Judge Powers would
desert him the instant it became to his interest
so to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder,&#8221; replied Helm, with a
smile. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t any place yet. I&#8217;m trying
to find my place.... If the
choice in, say, Lincoln&#8217;s day, had been what
it is now&mdash;between serving a knave and
serving a fool&mdash;between serving a knave
that&#8217;s owned by its money and serving a
fool that&#8217;s enslaved to the knave by its folly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>&mdash;if
Abe Lincoln had had choice between
those two rotten apples, I wonder which he
would have chosen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lincoln was a practical man,&#8221; said
Branagan. &#8220;He had all the cranks and romantic
reformers down on him. Don&#8217;t you
believe what the histories say. I <i>know</i> because
I lived then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;he was a practical man,&#8221; said
Helm. &#8220;He must have been, for he won.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I reckon you&#8217;ll win, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Helm, with a humorous
drawl, &#8220;I reckon I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>The excitement of boss over campaign
and victory is the same in kind as the excitement
of humblest, most fatuous partisan&mdash;though
it is vastly different in degree.
Branagan had been hypnotized out of his
sordidness&mdash;for the moment&mdash;by the issues
and by Helm. But even as he arranged
his mind for talking business with Reichman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
he returned to his normal state; and
when he and the Republican boss got together
for the grand pow-wow he was wondering
at his own sentimentality of a few
days before. The chief article of the treaty
of peace was no more George Helm.
Branagan agreed with a qualm and a genuine
regret, but he agreed as one obeying the
plain mandate of the instinct of self-preservation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish to God we could get him out of
the Senate,&#8221; said Reichman. &#8220;Of course
our boys in charge up at the capital will see
that he don&#8217;t get a chance to say much or
to do anything. Still, I wish he was back
in the ranks&mdash;away back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;he will be in two years,&#8221; said
Branagan. &#8220;And what&#8217;s two years in politics?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; assented Reichman.
&#8220;Two years isn&#8217;t any time, anywhere.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>&#8220;Except in jail,&#8221; said Branagan, with a
loud laugh.</p>

<p>Reichman conceded only the feeblest of
smiles to this coarse jest, savoring of innuendo.
&#8220;Those sort of chaps,&#8221; pursued
he, &#8220;have to be caught young and put out
of business. I&#8217;ve attended to a dozen of
&#8217;em in the last ten years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never &#8217;a touched him,&#8221; said Branagan,
&#8220;after that first campaign, if I hadn&#8217;t
been put in a position where I was forced
to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was my fault, Pat, I admit,&#8221;
said Reichman. &#8220;But it won&#8217;t occur
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, Emil,&#8221; said Pat. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
both had our lesson.... I won&#8217;t say
nothin&#8217; to Helm. I&#8217;ll keep him jollied
along until his term&#8217;s about up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;over he drops,&#8221; laughed Reichman.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>Branagan did not laugh. He liked
Helm. But he did nod&mdash;and Branagan&#8217;s
nod was as good as his word, and his word
he had never broken.</p>

<small>&#8220;THERE GOES A MAN&#8221;</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS. SALFIELD and Mrs. Ramon,
leaders in Cincinnati&#8217;s
fashionable society, were disposed
in a comfortable corner of Mrs.
Salfield&#8217;s ballroom. They were sheltered
from rheumatism-provoking draughts.
They were at conversational range from the
music. They commanded a full view of
the beautiful ball, even of the supper room,
where a dozen men were &#8220;mopping up the
champagne instead of doing their dancing
duty,&#8221; as Mrs. Ramon put it. Mrs. Ramon,
posing as of the younger generation,
went in&mdash;somewhat awkwardly&mdash;for the
&#8220;picturesque&#8221; in language. Mrs. Salfield,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
frankly an old woman, tolerated slang as
she tolerated rowdy modern manners and
&#8220;disgraceful, not to say indecent exposure
in ball dresses&#8221;; but in her own person she
adhered to the old fashions of moderately
low dresses and moderately incorrect English.
Said Mrs. Ramon:</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes that charming grandniece
of yours. How graceful she is. I thought
you told me she was twenty-nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor Clearwater&mdash;twenty-nine!&#8221; exclaimed
Mrs. Salfield. &#8220;She&#8217;s not yet
twenty-four.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I remember, you said she <i>looked</i>
twenty-nine&mdash;so serious&mdash;dignified&mdash;reserved&mdash;really
icy. But that was only two
months ago. She looks eighteen now. She&#8217;s
been away&mdash;hasn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just returned,&#8221; said Mrs. Salfield.</p>

<p>&#8220;It did her a world of good&mdash;freshened
her up&mdash;no, softened&mdash;no, I mean warmed.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>&#8220;She&#8217;s been visiting the Hollisters, down
at Harrison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A country town. I supposed she&#8217;d been
to baths or springs or something. Really
the change in her is quite miraculous. She
has waked up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor never was what one&#8217;d call
sleepy,&#8221; said Mrs. Salfield, rather stiffly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she was always interested in <i>things</i>&mdash;books,
serious subjects&mdash;too much so for
my taste. But you know what I mean.
She looks <i>human</i>&mdash;looks as if she had a
human interest. It was the one thing
lacking to make her entirely interesting
and beautiful&mdash;to give her magnetism.
You notice how the men flock about
her. She&#8217;s having a triumph. Why, she
looks round&mdash;looks at the men&mdash;in a positively
flirtatious way. Really, Clara, it&#8217;s
too wonderful. <i>What</i> has happened to
her?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>&#8220;What could happen to a girl in Harrison?
Nothing but Bart Hollister.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t be Bart,&#8221; said Mrs. Ramon.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t anybody,&#8221; said Mrs. Salfield.
&#8220;It&#8217;s simply a case of coming-to a little late.
So many young people take life too solemnly
at first. They feel responsible for
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The phenomenon thus noted by Mrs.
Ramon had escaped no one&#8217;s eyes. Even
Eleanor&#8217;s father, the absorbed George
Clearwater, United States Senator and
&#8220;lumber king,&#8221; had seen it. Eleanor Clearwater
had gone to Harrison, a reserved,
cool, not to say cold young woman, with an
air that made her seem years older than
she was, and with an interest in men so
faint that it discouraged all but two dauntless
fortune hunters&mdash;who were promptly
sent to look further. She had come back, a
lively, coquettish person, with a modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
tendency to audacities in dress and speech.
Every one wondered; no one could explain.
She could have explained, but she would
not have admitted the truth even to herself.
Four men proposed within two weeks
after her return. She refused them all&mdash;in
a gay, mocking way, thus enabling them to
feel that they had not humiliated themselves,
that she had imagined they were
proposing merely to make interesting conversation.</p>

<p>The cause she would not admit? A lank,
homely, ill dressed country town lawyer,
one George Helm. The year before he had
been the joke of Harrison because of his
absurd beard and his seedy suit with its
flowing tails. The shaving of the beard,
the changing of the &#8220;statesman&#8217;s frock&#8221; for
an ill fitting sack suit, two campaigns in
which he had developed power and originality
as a speaker, an election to the State<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
Senate by attacking &#8220;everything that was
respectable and decent,&#8221; that is, by telling
the truth about the upper-class grafters&mdash;these
circumstances had combined to make
him a considerable and serious figure in
Harrison. But for such as the Hollisters
and the Clearwaters he remained a bumpkin,
a demagogue, an impossible lower-class
person.</p>

<p>Yet he had wrought the wondrous, proposal-fraught
change in Miss Clearwater.
And he had done it by impudently pausing
at her phaeton in Harrison&#8217;s main street
and telling her, with exasperating indifference
to her icy manner, that he could marry
her if he wished but that he had no place
in his life for such a person as she.</p>

<p>Why had this transformed her? For two
reasons, both important to those men who
would fain have influence over one&mdash;or
more&mdash;of the female sex. The first is, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
he had been able to impress upon her the
fact that he was a worth-while person. The
second is, that he, being serious and simple,
had shown her that he, the man worth-while,
meant it when he said she was not a
girl a worth-while man would care to
marry. With these two propositions firmly
fixed in her head, Eleanor Clearwater could
not fail to see that it was &#8220;up to&#8221; her to
demonstrate her power over man.</p>

<p>She invited proposals&mdash;proposals not too
obviously incited chiefly by her charms as
an heiress. She got the proposals. But
still she was not satisfied. There was one
man&mdash;a homely man, but a man with far
and away the handsomest soul she had ever
seen&mdash;simple, proud, honest and fearless&mdash;looking
from eyes that were the more beautiful
for the rugged homeliness of the rest
of his face. This man whom her woman&#8217;s
heart defiantly told her was supremely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
worth-while&mdash;this man had said <i>she</i> was
not worth-while. Therefore, there were
worlds still defiantly unconquered&mdash;which
meant that nothing was conquered. It irritated
her&mdash;as her father had been irritated
until all the lumber interests had been gathered
in under his lordship. It irritated
her yet more profoundly that such an absurdity
as this gentle and friendly disdain
of bucolic homeliness should irritate her.
But she could not change her nature.</p>

<p>He had set her to thinking about him.
He had her worried, as the saying is. And
when a man gets a woman in that state, she
will not emerge from it until something
definite has occurred.</p>

<p>Woman has little to think about but men&mdash;thanks
to a social system cunningly contrived
by man for his own benefit. She
thinks of man in general until she centers
upon one man. She then thinks of him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
until she finds him out. When that comes
to pass, she goes back to men in general,
until a new personal interest develops.
This, so long as any remnant of charm gives
her hope. Man is woman&#8217;s career. Not so
with men; not so with George Helm, State
Senator-elect and desperately in earnest
about making a career.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While Eleanor Clearwater was sleeping
away the excitements of the Salfield ball in
her attractive bedroom in the Clearwater
palace, George Helm was at work several
hundred miles away in his dingy back office
in the Masonic Building at Harrison.
When she should be awakened by her maid
to dress for her first engagement of the day,
she would soon be thinking of George
Helm&mdash;thinking how ugly and obscure and
ungainly he was&mdash;and what magnetic eyes
he had. Thinking the more, the more she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
tried not to think. But George Helm was
not thinking of her at all.</p>

<p>He was sitting beside the rickety old
table in a wooden chair, a kitchen chair. It
was tilted back and Helm&#8217;s long lank legs
were tangled up with each other and with
the rungs in amazing twists. Perhaps you
have happened to know an occasional man&mdash;or
woman&mdash;whose every act and trick of
manner had an inexplicable fascination.
When George Helm was self-conscious, he
had no more magnetism than is inseparable
from intelligent, sympathetic good nature
sunning in a kindly keen sense of humor.
But the instant he lost self-consciousness&mdash;as
he always did on the platform, and as he
was more and more doing in private life,
now that he had begun to have success&mdash;that
instant he became a magnet, one of
those human magnets who interest you, no
matter what they do, and in repose. Even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
in bed&mdash;that too short, sagging bed in the
attic of Mrs. Beaver&#8217;s boarding-house&mdash;even
as he lay doubled up, there was the
fascination of the unique, the perfectly natural
and unassuming.</p>

<p>As he sat twisted in and upon the wobbly
kitchen chair, his friend, lazy Bill Desbrough,
from across the hall, looked in
every few minutes, hoping George would
encourage him to enter. It was curious
about George Helm, how in spite of his
lack of what passes for dignity, no one ever&mdash;even
in the days when he was thought to
be a joke&mdash;&#8220;the boy with that beard&#8221;&mdash;no
one ever ventured to interrupt him without
an encouraging look from those deep-set
blue-gray eyes.</p>

<p>At last George looked up and smiled as
Bill stood in the doorway. He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, you loafer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s State Senator-elect Helm to-day?&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
inquired Bill, lounging in, his hands
in his pockets, his pipe hanging from the
corner of his mouth. &#8220;How does it feel to
be famous?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be less obscure,&#8221; corrected George.
He had a passion&mdash;and a genius&mdash;for accuracy.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be famous,&#8221; insisted Desbrough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know who is State Senator for
the district adjoining this&mdash;on either side?&mdash;or
to the north or south?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill Desbrough&#8217;s laugh was confession.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are fifty State Senators in this
State alone,&#8221; continued George. &#8220;There
are forty-eight States in the Union. Fifty
times forty-eight&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you trying to make yourself
out so small?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or&mdash;to look at it another way, I belong
to the Democratic boss of Harrison&mdash;Pat
Branagan, saloon-keeper. He belongs to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
the Republican boss, Al Reichman. Al
belongs to Senator Harvey Sayler, the State
boss. Sayler belongs to the big monopolistic
combines that center in Wall Street.
They belong to a dozen big plutocrats who
belong to about three of their number. And
those three belong to their money&mdash;do
what it says, say and think what it tells &#8217;em
to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re happy now,&#8221; said Bill.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve made yourself out to be about
equal to a patch on the ragged pant-leg of
some cotton-picking coon working for the
sub-lessee of a mortgaged farm in a poor
corner of Arkansas.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or, to look at it another way,&#8221; continued
Helm, untwisting his legs, immediately
to re-knot them in an even more intricate
tangle, &#8220;a State Senator gets six dollars
a day while the Legislature&#8217;s in session.
It meets for sixty days every two years.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
His term&#8217;s four years. So, my money value
as the State sees it is one hundred and
eighty dollars a year&mdash;about fifty cents
a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you&#8217;ve shrunk yourself
back to normal human size,&#8221; said his friend.
&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re doing this
for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Bill. To locate myself. I want to
see just where I stand. The slave of a slave
of a slave of a slave of a slave of a slave of
a slave&mdash;I think that&#8217;s the right degree&mdash;and
at fifty cents a day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Branagan gives you some pretty good
law cases,&#8221; suggested Bill.</p>

<p>Helm eyed him somberly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know you don&#8217;t want to be too <i>damn</i>
independent, old man,&#8221; continued Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;To locate myself,&#8221; pursued Helm, as if
Bill had not spoken. &#8220;I want to see just
how far I&#8217;ve got to go before&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>He paused here. Said Bill&mdash;not altogether
in jest, &#8220;Before you&#8217;re President of
the U. S. A.?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said George gravely. &#8220;Before I&#8217;m
a man. Before I belong to myself.&#8221; He
laughed with his peculiar illumination of
the whole face apparently from the light
of the eyes. &#8220;You see, Bill, I&#8217;m aiming to
go further than most Presidents&mdash;especially
these latter-day chaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Further than most plutocrats,&#8221; said
Desbrough. &#8220;As you said, <i>they</i> belong to
their boodle bags.... You haven&#8217;t
broken with Branagan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; said Helm. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to,
soon after the Legislature opens. You see,
we&#8217;re the minority, and nowadays the majority-boss
always uses the minority votes
to put through whatever dirty business a
lot of his men have to be let off from voting
for.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>&#8220;Well&mdash;don&#8217;t break with good old Pat
till you have to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get all I can first, you may be sure,&#8221;
said Helm. &#8220;I&#8217;m a practical man&mdash;that is,
I&#8217;m a practical politician, with a dangerous,
incurable hankering for being a man&mdash;self-owned
and self-bossed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You give Branagan good legal service
for what he pays you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he hasn&#8217;t yet asked me to do any
law work that I&#8217;ve not been able to stand
for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pat&#8217;s a little afraid of you,&#8221; declared
Desbrough. &#8220;He knows how strong you
are with the people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm slowly shook his head. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
deceive myself. He&#8217;s saving me till he
really needs me.&#8221; He straightened out his
long figure deliberately, rose and began to
pace up and down the office. &#8220;It&#8217;s all a
question of money, Bill. In this day a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
has got to have an independence&mdash;or do
what some other man says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could speak as you can&mdash;and hold
the crowds&mdash;and draw in their votes&mdash;&mdash;
You, a Democrat, elected from this district
of shell-back Republicans who talk about
the Civil War as if Morgan was still
raiding the State.&#8221; Bill laughed. &#8220;Why
don&#8217;t you drop politics, George? Why
fool with the silly game? The people&#8217;ll
never learn anything. They can always be
buncoed&mdash;the asses! What did God make
&#8217;em for? To work like hell all day and
then hand over most of what they&#8217;ve made
to some clever chap&mdash;and thank him for
taking it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That used to be so,&#8221; replied Helm.
&#8220;But they&#8217;re waking up, Bill. All they need
is the right kind of leaders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meaning you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meaning me,&#8221; said Helm. And his expression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
far removed his statement from
vanity or egotism.</p>

<p>Desbrough puffed at his pipe in silence.
Presently he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You can count me in, George&mdash;if there&#8217;s
anything I can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did not shake hands. They exchanged
no gushing remarks. They did not
look at each other with exalted sentimentality.
They simply looked&mdash;then George
grinned and nodded&mdash;and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Bill. You&#8217;re in.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long silence. Then Desbrough:</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that I believe in the game, old man.
I don&#8217;t. I despise the people. I&#8217;d go in
with the wise boys who rob them if I didn&#8217;t
happen to have inherited enough to slop
along on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much have you got?&#8221; said George&mdash;a
necessary question, as this was to be a
partnership.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>&#8220;Nineteen hundred and fifty a year&mdash;county
bonds and a farm. My law practice&mdash;I
made seventy-five dollars last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t take anything but people
too poor to pay&mdash;and then only when you
think they&#8217;re being wronged by somebody
with money. That&#8217;s why I asked you in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Desbrough stopped
and laughed. &#8220;Yes, you did, come to think
of it. I&#8217;d never have offered if you hadn&#8217;t
made me feel that you wanted me. I&#8217;d not
have done it even then, if you hadn&#8217;t compelled
me. How do you compel people
to do things without even asking &#8217;em,
George?&#8221;</p>

<p>For reply Helm laughed. Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;Nineteen hundred and fifty a year.
That&#8217;s enough for you. I must have more&mdash;about
five thousand a year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can make it at the law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the gang didn&#8217;t shut me out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
courts, when I broke with them. And if
I&#8217;d take crooked cases. I&#8217;ve thought that
all out. It can&#8217;t be done any more. Lincoln
and the big fellows of the past could.
But that was a different day. Now all the
law cases worth-while&mdash;all the good fees&mdash;come
from the very chaps I&#8217;ve got to attack.
A lawyer who has done any business
as a lawyer can go into politics in only one
way&mdash;and that&#8217;s a more or less crooked way.
I&#8217;ve thought it all out, Bill. I can&#8217;t afford
to make an independence, and then wash
up and go in on the level. I hoped I
could see my way clear to do it. But&mdash;I
can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you won&#8217;t get money any other
way,&#8221; said Desbrough. &#8220;And if you
haven&#8217;t got the money to live on and to
carry on your campaigns, why, you&#8217;re
beaten in advance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t forgotten my campaign for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
judge,&#8221; said Helm. &#8220;Bill, I&#8217;ve learned a
thing or two about practical politics. I&#8217;m
going to play cards&mdash;not play the fool.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not marry Clara Hollister?&#8221; cried
Desbrough, suddenly inspired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would she have you?&#8221; asked Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Me?</i> Good Lord, what&#8217;d <i>I</i> do with
another wife? I had <i>one</i>, and am paying
alimony. No, I mean <i>you</i> marry Clara.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm laughed uproariously. &#8220;Take another
look at me, Bill,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Women don&#8217;t know anything about
handsome and ugly in men,&#8221; said Bill.
&#8220;Besides, you&#8217;re not what <i>women&#8217;d</i> call
plain. Don&#8217;t laugh, George. I&#8217;d back you
to win any woman you took after. A man
that can catch crowds can catch a woman.
With a woman, it isn&#8217;t what a man <i>looks</i>.
It&#8217;s what he <i>says</i>&mdash;and does.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got no woman-talk,&#8221; said Helm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;You can grab off Clara Hollister if you
want her&mdash;and she has twenty thousand a
year in her own right. And she&#8217;ll let you
do what you please with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her father&#8217;s the head devil in these
parts of the gang I&#8217;m after.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The twenty thousand&#8217;s hers. She&#8217;s a
good deal of a snob, but she&#8217;d be what you
wanted her to be, if you married her.
That&#8217;s the way it is with women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that your experience?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I spoke from experience,&#8221; replied Desbrough,
undaunted. &#8220;I made my wife over
when I married her&mdash;and then didn&#8217;t like
the job. I&#8217;d rather pay alimony than be
constantly reminded of my failure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I can&#8217;t marry for independence,&#8221;
said Helm. &#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t have me and&mdash;I
don&#8217;t want her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;why not that friend of hers&mdash;that
Miss Clearwater? I saw you talking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
to her down the street one day before the
election. She&#8217;d be less easy to manage than
Clara. But no woman&#8217;s difficult&mdash;for a
firm man who&#8217;s patient and can keep his
temper&mdash;and isn&#8217;t in love.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm had become acutely self-conscious
and so awkward that a chair which was apparently
not near his path became involved
with his big feet and fell on its side with a
crash. As Helm straightened from picking
it up, he was extraordinarily red for the
amount of exertion. Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave the women out of it. I&#8217;m not a
marrying man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Desbrough laughed mockingly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
find out you&#8217;re mistaken&mdash;as soon as you&#8217;ve
got money enough to make it worth a needy
woman&#8217;s while to take after you. <i>I</i> thought
<i>I</i> wasn&#8217;t a marrying man. Three months
and four days after my uncle died and left
me that money I was waiting at the altar.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a marrying man,&#8221; repeated
Helm awkwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;In some ways Miss Clearwater would
be just the girl for you. She&#8217;d take an interest
in your career. She has ideals&mdash;and
they&#8217;re about as far removed from her
father&#8217;s as a church from a speak-easy. I
think she&#8217;s got money of her own. Yes, I&#8217;m
sure she has. Her mother left her what the
old man had settled on her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I did marry,&#8221; said Helm, abruptly
self-possessed, &#8220;it&#8217;d be a woman that suited
<i>me</i>&mdash;one I felt at home with. I want no
grand rich ladies, Bill. Anyhow, I&#8217;ve
thought of another way&mdash;one that&#8217;s practical.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he seated himself and proceeded to
unfold the scheme upon which he had been
seriously at work ever since the election.
It was a simple scheme, wisely devoid of
untried originality, but effective. His two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
campaigns, despite the silence of the plutocracy-controlled
press, had got him a considerable
reputation throughout the State.
The press is not so necessary to the spread
of intelligence as is latterly imagined. Long
before there was a press, long before there
was any written means of communication,
news and knowledge of all kinds spread
rapidly throughout the world, pausing only
at the great desert stretches between peoples&mdash;and
not often halted there for long.
The old ways of communication have not
been closed up. To this day the real and
great reputations of the world are not
press-made or press-sustained or even materially
press-assisted. They are the work
of mouth-to-mouth communication. And
those reputations, by the way, are they
against which the calumny and the innuendo
of the press strive in vain.</p>

<p>It had spread from man to man throughout<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
the State that there had arisen in Harrison
a strange, plain youth of great sincerity
as a man and of great power as a
speaker. The Jews of ancient days are not
the only people who have dreamed of a
Messiah. The Messiah-dream, the Messiah-longing
has been the dream and the
longing of the whole human race, toiling
away in obscurity, oppressed, exploited,
fooled, despised. Hence, news of leaders
springing up spreads fast and far among
the people. The news about Helm was
hardly more than a rumor. A hundred
miles from Harrison, and they had his name
wrong. A little further, and they hadn&#8217;t
yet heard his name. But far and wide there
was the rumor of a light in the direction of
Harrison. Would it be a little star or a
big? a fixed star or a mere comet?&mdash;would
it prove to be nothing but a meteorite, flashing
and fading out? Would it be a sun?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
These questions not definite, but simply the
vague, faint suggestion of question.</p>

<p>The people!&mdash;how little we understand
them&mdash;how much and how often we misunderstand
them. The people, so ignorant,
yet so quaintly wise&mdash;as they toil in the obscurity,
building patiently, working and
hoping&mdash;and waiting always for leaders.
Deceived a thousand times, they wait on
and hope on&mdash;since leaders they must have,
and since leaders will surely come.</p>

<p>Helm did not exaggerate the public interest
in himself. If anything he, the most
cautiously Caledonian of career-builders,
estimated his reputation at less than it was.
But he had the true man of the people&#8217;s instinct
for the feeling of the people. His
crusading spirit was not either academic or
fanatic. It was the sensible indignation of
the man who discovers that a certain evil
has gone far enough and must be put down.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
He felt that, if he could manage his career
sensibly, he could make it all he wished.
The pressing problem was how to increase
this reputation into fame of the kind useful
to his purposes as a public man, and how to
transform that increased reputation into a
cleanly-acquired independence.</p>

<p>&#8220;And it seems to me, Bill,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that
the best available plan is a lecture tour&mdash;through
the towns, villages, crossroads hamlets
of the whole State.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Talking politics? Nobody&#8217;ll listen to
politics except round election time. That&#8217;s
why robbing the people&#8217;s the easiest and the
favorite way to make money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything&#8217;s politics,&#8221; said Helm.
&#8220;Religion&#8217;s politics, and education&#8217;s politics,
and farming and mining and factories
and doctors and storekeeping&mdash;everything!
What&#8217;s politics but settling how the proceeds
of everybody&#8217;s labor are to be distributed&mdash;whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
the man who works is to
get what he works for or somebody else is
to get it? And that question means everything
that affects any human being,
morally, mentally, physically. I&#8217;m going
to talk politics, but they&#8217;ll not
know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do <i>I</i> come in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re to be my manager&mdash;arrange the
dates and so on. It&#8217;s got to be arranged
while I&#8217;m busy in the Legislature, in January
and February. I&#8217;ll do what I can
there to make myself talked about. You&#8217;ll
correspond with culture clubs and literary
circles and churches that want debts raised
and public schools and trade schools with
lecture courses.&#8221;</p>

<p>Desbrough looked willing but helpless.
&#8220;Is there much chance to lecture in this
State?&#8221; said he. &#8220;I thought that sort of
thing had died out.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>&#8220;If it had, we&#8217;d raise it from the dead,&#8221;
said Helm. &#8220;But it hasn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took from the drawer of his table a
bundle of papers. He waved them triumphantly
at his friend, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Here it is, Bill&mdash;all down in black and
white. A hundred and eighty-six chances
to lecture&mdash;if it&#8217;s worked right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Desbrough, the lazy man, groaned.
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you pick out somebody else,
damn you!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;You offered,&#8221; said Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You hypnotized me,&#8221; retorted Desbrough.
&#8220;Lord, what a pile of work!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Helm. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to begin
right away. I calculate to make twenty-five
hundred dollars by the first of June. I
want to build this thing up in a couple of
years into a steady income of five to ten
thousand&mdash;an income nobody can touch so
long as people&#8217;ll come out to hear me.&#8221; The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
handsome blue-gray eyes looked anxiously
from the homely face. &#8220;Bill, am I deceiving
myself? Do you think they&#8217;ll <i>pay</i> to
hear <i>me</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t expect &#8217;em to pay much&mdash;at
first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking it&#8217;d be about right to ask
ten dollars for the little places, and fifteen
to thirty for the bigger ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to feel that out,&#8221; said Bill.
&#8220;Leave something for the manager to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put the prices low, Bill,&#8221; said George.
&#8220;It&#8217;s safer. Also, we want to reach <i>all</i> the
people. And I&#8217;m going to write some lectures
that&#8217;ll educate &#8217;em in what&#8217;s going on
under their noses. About these lectures&mdash;they&#8217;re
to be a mixture of humorous and
serious. I&#8217;ve got a lot of good stories I can
work in. The first lecture&#8217;s pretty nearly
ready.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>&#8220;What&#8217;s it about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The American Home&mdash;as it was&mdash;as it
is&mdash;as it should be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wit, wisdom and weeps?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds good. I begin to feel that
there&#8217;s something in it.... Look
here, Helm&mdash;that tour&#8217;s going to be a
frightful strain on your health.&#8221;</p>

<p>George looked down at his long lean figure
in the baggy blue suit. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t
anything about me to get sick, Bill,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;Back where I come from they dry
&#8217;em out like an oak board before they send
&#8217;em away from home. All the germs get
when they tackle us folks is broken teeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why does the world insist on believing
that luck is the deciding factor in human
affairs? Why is the successful man forced
to pretend that he is &#8220;fortune&#8217;s favorite,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
under penalty of being despised as a plodding
or scheming fellow, if he does not?
Because most men either cannot or will not
plan. They &#8220;trust to luck&#8221;&mdash;and lose,
except in romances and equally fictitious
biographies. Without exception, all success
is the result of plan. If a man has success
thrust into his hands, it is immediately
snatched away unless he plans wisely to
keep it. If a successful man is wholly or
partly ruined by chance, his habit of successful
planning soon restores all that has
been lost. Luck is an element for which
every wise man makes allowance in his
planning&mdash;for the good luck that will enable
him to shorten his journey along the
road he would have traveled in any event,
for the bad luck that may lengthen the
journey. Good and bad luck affect rate,
not direction&mdash;among the men who attain
to and persist in the triumphant class, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
the successful grocer to the successful poet
or composer.</p>

<p>That winter luck favored George Helm.
He did not have to break with the machine.</p>

<p>Senator Sayler, the representative of the
plutocracy, quarreled with some of his
largest clients&mdash;his bosses, they fancied
themselves, until he, as astute as he was
bold and cynical, showed them that he had
made himself indispensable to them. He,
the rich man as well as the expert and most
intelligent politician; they, merely rich
men, crudely buying of politicians the coveted
robbers&#8217; licenses. The quarrel grew
out of the idiotic greediness of his clients.
They wished to rob to the point where the
goose begins to squawk&mdash;and forthwith
changes from goose into a creature of a
wholly different kind, fighting with ferocity
for life. Sayler proceeded to teach them
a lesson. He, ostensibly head of the Republican<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
machine and hostile to everything
connected with the Democratic party,
ordered his faithful ally-lieutenant, the
Democratic State boss, Hazelrigg, to make
a vigorous unsparing campaign against the
plutocracy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give &#8217;em hell,&#8221; said Sayler. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
turn loose a lot of long-eared cranks.
They frighten sensible people and make the
plutocracy stronger. Dig up some earnest,
conscientious young fellows&mdash;if there are
any such that haven&#8217;t been brought up for
these stupid brutes we&#8217;re going to teach a
lesson.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazelrigg had heard of Helm. Pat
Branagan had given Helm a letter to him,
but Helm had not presented it and had
been keeping out of sight until he should
have spied out the new land of the State
capital. He sent for Helm to look him
over. Hazelrigg was a college man who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
had made up his mind to be rich. Discovering,
after a few years of effort by honest
ways, that if he succeeded at all it would
be when he was too old to enjoy, he had
taken the short cut&mdash;with notable success.
Being the minority boss, he could maintain
a pose of virtue that deceived all but shrewd
eyes. He understood Helm in the main at
a glance&mdash;asked him to speak against a
rotten bill then pending. Helm spoke.</p>

<p>Hazelrigg listened with mingled feelings
of joy and fear. &#8220;We must keep him poor,&#8221;
he said to himself. &#8220;Then he can&#8217;t make
trouble for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before the first month was over, Hazelrigg
had made George Helm the chief
spokesman of the party in its campaign
against the rapacities of the plutocracy.
The old wheel-horse orators, familiar and
more or less discredited slobberers of virtuous
sentiments from mouths raw and ragged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
with corruption, were angered and made
futile attempts to &#8220;haze&#8221; the new favorite.
Hazelrigg soon quelled that mutiny. Of
all the understrappers at the beck and call
of a machine boss, the orators&mdash;they upon
whose lips the people hang spellbound&mdash;are
the lowest, the most despised by their
fellow slaves and the most brutally worked
and the most meagerly paid.</p>

<p>As Sayler had taken the muzzle from the
press of the State to make his &#8220;object lesson&#8221;
thoroughly effective, in a few weeks
George Helm became famous&mdash;newspaper
famous&mdash;the beanstalk variety of fame,
showy but perishable. Bill Desbrough
came up to see him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The lecture scheme&#8217;s off&mdash;isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;By no means,&#8221; replied Helm. &#8220;I&#8217;ll let
you into my secret, Bill. You&#8217;re close-mouthed&mdash;closer
mouthed than I am.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>&#8220;I doubt it,&#8221; said Desbrough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, for <i>I&#8217;m</i> telling you my secret&mdash;and
<i>you&#8217;ll</i> not tell anybody. Here&#8217;s the secret!
By those lecture tours I&#8217;m going to build up
in every part of this State a machine of my
own&mdash;groups of people I can trust and who
feel they can trust me. There&#8217;s some skullduggery
back of this spasm of party virtue.
It won&#8217;t last. We must hurry and make all
we can out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most men cannot see the obvious, even
when it is pointed out to them. The occasional
rare man&mdash;the man of genius of one
kind or another&mdash;is he who sees the obvious
without assistance. In between these two
classes lies a third class, not small like that
of genius&mdash;yet not huge like the other.
To this third class&mdash;those able to see the
obvious if and when it is pointed out to
them&mdash;belonged William Desbrough. He
reflected on what George Helm had said;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
and up went his admiration a considerable
number of notches. Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;George, what a run you&#8217;ll give &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm clapped him on the shoulder with
his loud, joyous, boyish laugh. &#8220;Put all
your money on that, Bill!&#8221; cried he.</p>

<p>Helm&#8217;s successes wrought in him the
usual swift change. The temperament of
success, the ability to throw one&#8217;s whole
concentrated self into an enterprise, involves
a highly organized nervous system&mdash;hence,
extreme sensitiveness, torments from
anxiety and from self-doubt. Only an iron
constitution could have borne the fatigues
of that first campaign of his&mdash;the now famous
&#8220;buggy&#8221; campaign&mdash;with its nerve
strain of the man fighting again desperate
odds to save himself from ruin under avalanches
of ridicule. And when he finally
&#8220;made good&#8221; in his home district, the question
at once arose, &#8220;But can I make good at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
the capital?&#8221; This question was in the
way to be answered with an emphatic
yes.</p>

<p>The respect with which he was treated
by other men&mdash;men of consequence! The
serious attention the papers gave his utterances!
The huge piles of letters praising
his courage, his logic, his freedom from
crude abuse, his clearness of statement&mdash;letters
from all parts of the State, from all
parts of the Union! Those letters made his
heart burn with new energy and high hope.
He had indeed guessed right. The people&mdash;his
people&mdash;the long-suffering masses
were certainly on the alert for a leader.
Yes, he was in the way to accomplish something
of what he had resolved when he left
the farm, because he was intelligent enough
to discover that the big monopolies headed
by the railway trusts had reduced the nominally
independent farmer to the slavery of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
the poorly paid wage-earner of the cities
and towns. He was in the way to be of use
in the gigantic task of restoring democracy
and opportunity to the republic.</p>

<p>This man, planted upon this rock-founded
confidence, could not but show in
his exterior the external change. But where
the small fellow reveals his fleeting or
trivial success in an access of swagger, the
large, simple nature reveals it in the deeper
absorption in the career, the lessened consciousness
of self. And as George Helm&#8217;s
self-consciousness had been the sole cause
of his awkwardness and the chief cause of
his extreme plainness, the change was most
striking. He was no longer awkward. His
long, spare figure revealed&mdash;as it always
had on the platform after the first embarrassed
moment&mdash;the innate grace that is in
every natural, self-conscious creature. As
for the homeliness&mdash;how can a strong face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
be homely when in place of the unattractive
expression of shy greenness there come the
dignity and beauty of a large intelligence
fittingly occupied? &#8220;There goes a man who
amounts to something,&#8221; they now said
about Helm. And when you hear that said
of a man, you may be sure he will not turn
to you a homely face.</p>

<p>Senator Sayler had come on from Washington
and had taken a house in the suburbs
for the session because of the importance
of the curious program he was
putting through. He went to hear Helm
speak against one of the grab bills his refractory
clients were insisting upon. Sayler,
as you knew, was a cynic; and when
you find cynicism in a man, you may be
sure you are at the cover for a lively and
annoying secret self-contempt. He listened
with his most cynical smile to the simple,
sensible eloquence of the young farmer-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
lawyer. But, as he listened, he was
saying to himself, &#8220;We must attack this
fellow, but it will not be easy.&#8221; Afterward
he had Hazelrigg bring Helm to the Lieutenant
Governor&#8217;s private room and talked
with him for an hour. He would have
talked much longer, had there not been a
gentle knock at the door.</p>

<p>He disregarded it. The door opened and
in came his wife&mdash;and Eleanor Clearwater.
Mrs. Sayler&mdash;the trained wife of the public
man&mdash;smiled engagingly at Helm and said
to her husband:</p>

<p>&#8220;We simply can&#8217;t wait any longer, Harvey.
We were wondering how you dared
keep us waiting. But if we had known
whom you had with you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; She put out
her hand to Helm. &#8220;That was a splendid
speech, Mr. Helm. I don&#8217;t know you, but
it made me feel as if I did. I detest politics
but not the kind <i>you</i> talk.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>Helm lapsed toward, but not into, his
former awkwardness. He might have done
better had not Eleanor been standing there,
not all dignity and ice, but all merry smiles
and impatience to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do, Mr. Helm?&#8221; said she,
as soon as Mrs. Sayler finished. &#8220;Father
and I came to stop with Mrs. Sayler only
this morning&mdash;and here you are. Really,
it&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;what shall I call it&mdash;our always
running across each other?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm had no woman-talk. He stood&mdash;not
too awkwardly&mdash;and silently gazed at
the lovely and radiant young lady so unaccountably
transformed from her former
cold reserve. And, as the astute Sayler did
not fail to note, he looked at her hungrily.
Even Carlotta Sayler, the self-absorbed, saw
in Helm&#8217;s tell-tale face that there was
&#8220;something or other between those two&mdash;though
how could it possibly be!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>&#8220;I was about to ask Mr. Helm to dine
with us to-morrow night,&#8221; said Sayler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do,&#8221; cried Carlotta, who never
missed a cue. &#8220;It&#8217;s to be early and most
informal&mdash;no evening clothes or such nonsense.
Won&#8217;t it be delightful, Eleanor?
Your father will be so pleased to meet one
of <i>our</i> coming men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Helm was framing a refusal when
he caught in Eleanor&#8217;s eyes a look of appeal&mdash;a
pleading request that he accept. Nor
had he the excuse that Sayler was of the
enemy. Sayler had shown him that he harbored
no such petty notions of obligation
as possess the average man who fancies that
his foe ought to become his friend if he does
him the honor of giving him a free cigar, or
a free dinner, or a free drink. Also, he
wished to talk with Sayler again. Sayler,
expert at the political game, had in their
hour&#8217;s talk taught him more than he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
learned of all the other men with whom
he had discussed politics. And Sayler was&mdash;for
some mysterious reason&mdash;eager to give
him the ammunition of facts about the
doings of the plutocracy which he most
needed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;ll be glad to
come,&#8221; said Helm. He added, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard
you&#8217;re very dressy out at your place. You&#8217;re
<i>sure</i> you won&#8217;t mind my clothes? I haven&#8217;t
any dress suits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A <i>man</i> can go where he pleases in what
he pleases,&#8221; said Sayler. &#8220;But there&#8217;s no
truth in that report about us. The women
at our place are dressy, of course. They
always are everywhere. If they&#8217;re not that,
they think they&#8217;re not anything&mdash;and perhaps
they&#8217;re right. But it&#8217;s go-as-you-please
with the men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler discovered that he wished to look
at the west wing of the capitol, walked with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
his wife, thus forcing Helm to walk with
Eleanor&mdash;and to walk ahead where he
could observe. There was plenty to see.</p>

<p>A serious young woman is never in any
circumstances so interesting to a man as a
light and gay, pretty woman, whatever men
may pretend. It is inborn in the male to
regard the female as the representative of
the lighter side of life; and <i>so long as he is
not married to her</i>, light she should be if she
would please him&mdash;light and full of coquetry
of the kind he happens to regard as
&#8220;womanly.&#8221; George Helm had cherished
deep in his heart a peculiar feeling for
Eleanor Clearwater since that first long
talk he had with her, the only woman he
had met who possessed worldly knowledge
and beauty, refined and glorified by the
highest civilized arts of manner and dress.
Not love&mdash;not possibility of love, though
he fancied it was love! Rather, a feeling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
that here at last was a representative of the
best in womankind&mdash;and George Helm,
like all the ambitious, was born with the
passion for the best of everything.</p>

<p>But this Eleanor was no longer the empedestaled
goddess, the passive recipient of
the homage due her beauty and her taste
and her station. She had come to life; she
had descended from her pedestal; she had
placed herself&mdash;no, not within reach of
men, but most tantalizingly less out of
reach. And she spent that half hour or so
in deliberately trying to captivate him, in
putting him at ease, in making him feel
that she was almost if not quite within
reach. She did not herself realize&mdash;but
Harvey Sayler did&mdash;how far she was going.
But neither did she realize how much she
had been affected by the fact that each time
she saw this man he had made a stride forward
as with seven league boots away from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
the crudeness of the bucolic and toward his
certain goal of power with vast masses of
men. If she had not heard the speech before
she saw him, if she had not found her
own opinion confirmed by Sayler&#8217;s manner
toward him, she probably would not have
gone so far. Not because she was calculating,
you reader ever ready to discover your
own deepest failings, however slightly manifested
in another; but because she was human&mdash;delightfully
human, since George
Helm had dropped her abruptly down
from the perch to which she had been raised
by lifelong flatteries and extravagant compliment.</p>

<p>However, it was not until after dinner
the following night that she really &#8220;laid
siege.&#8221; She was alone with poor Helm in
the library&mdash;how cleverly the sly Sayler
had maneuvered that!</p>

<p>You have seen a large fish moving in ease<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
and grace through the water? You have
seen that same fish flopping and floundering
and flapping about on land to which the
angler has drawn it? That visualizes
George Helm, at home among men, among
politicians, or making a speech, and George
Helm in a drawing-room among a lot of
women in dresses cut as he had seen them
cut only in illustrations. And the most
ludicrous part of it all was that he fancied
himself perfectly at ease. Eleanor Clearwater
had hypnotized him into imagining
his flounderings were like his motions in his
native element.</p>

<p>Said she at length&mdash;any woman and almost
any man can supply the preliminary
or leading-up conversation:</p>

<p>&#8220;What a fascinating career you will have!
Oh, I know you haven&#8217;t told me about it.
You simply won&#8217;t talk about yourself, and
have made me tell you everything about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
myself from bibs up. But I can guess your
career.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We had only got you as far as short
dresses,&#8221; said he. &#8220;When you left that
boarding school&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing since,&#8221; interrupted she. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
simply been sitting round waiting for a
husband. What else is there for a woman?
Still, I never wish I&#8217;d been a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked George. He was
twisted into one of his strange poses&mdash;legs
wound round each other, body bent forward,
supported by his elbows. He had
never been so blissfully, airily happy as
watching this beautiful girl, with the most
wonderful light he had ever beheld reflecting
from her fair shoulders.</p>

<p>She looked at him with eyes suddenly
grave. &#8220;Because as a woman I have the
chance to be some day loved by a man. As
a man&#8221;&mdash;her eyes danced&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;d have had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
nothing to look forward to but just a
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What kind of a man do you want?&#8221;
asked he&mdash;and his honest, rugged face
showed in its frank innocence how impersonal
the question was.</p>

<p>&#8220;A man like you,&#8221; said she audaciously,
her face merry.</p>

<p>He laughed loudly&mdash;a contagious outburst
of joyous good humor that made the
luxurious, conventional room seem a poor
sort of place. Such a laugh is a very different
matter from one that seems a poor,
noisy sort of clamor in a room.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have courage&mdash;strength. You
don&#8217;t pose.&#8221; All this she said with the
lightness that made it in good taste&mdash;and
none the less sincere. &#8220;You are on the side
all these other men have deserted as soon
as they became prosperous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I shall, too,&#8221; said he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>&#8220;I suppose it must be the wrong side, or
surely all of them wouldn&#8217;t have left it.
But&mdash;somehow, I think you won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; said he. And <i>he</i>&mdash;his real
self&mdash;began to look from his eyes&mdash;and to
look at her.</p>

<p>In spite of herself, she became serious.
&#8220;No&mdash;you can&#8217;t,&#8221; assented she, absently.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve changed&mdash;every time I&#8217;ve seen
you. But not in that one respect. Whenever
I look at you, I still see&mdash;as I did that
first time&mdash;farms and factories&mdash;and thousands
of men and women at work&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And children,&#8221; he interrupted, a strange,
somehow ferocious note in his quiet voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t forget them,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I try
to, but I don&#8217;t.... No, you&#8217;ll not change
sides. And you&#8217;ll marry some woman on
that side, and she&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll marry the woman I want&mdash;when I
can afford to marry,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
aren&#8217;t on one side or the other. This is a
man&#8217;s fight. A woman&mdash;she goes with the
man who takes her.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled with some raillery. &#8220;Be careful
to select the woman of that sort,&#8221; said
she, &#8220;or you may have to change your mind&mdash;suddenly
and rather disagreeably&mdash;about
women.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a large gesture of indifference.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t care about women?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>A look of melancholy came into his face.
He said with a quaint smile, &#8220;They began
it. They don&#8217;t care about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a foolish question!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re mistaken,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Any
woman would <i>like</i> you, and if a woman fell
in love with you she&#8217;d be crazy about you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed boyishly as at a huge joke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a peculiar sort of man&mdash;a sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
not many women would appreciate. If
you find one who does, you&#8217;ll see that I was
right. She&#8217;ll be a peculiar sort of woman
and she&#8217;ll belong to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was pathos in his expression of
gratitude. She saw it, understood it&mdash;and
the tears welled into her eyes. What a
lonely, fascinating figure of a man&mdash;so different
from all other men&mdash;so modest about
himself&mdash;and with such incredibly luminous
eyes, tender yet strong. She was looking
directly at him. The changing expression
of his eyes terrified her&mdash;fascinated
her. He stood up, and his gesture compelled
her to stand also&mdash;and to look at
him. He stretched out his powerful arm.
She tried to draw back; she could not.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; said he in an awed, hushed
voice, his eyes looking at her wonderingly,
&#8220;I believe <i>you</i> are the woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had misunderstood, she said to herself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
Then&mdash; &#8220;No,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;I&#8217;ve
been leading him on. What a foolish,
bad thing to do! And he thinks I was
in earnest&mdash;when nothing could induce
me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He interrupted her thoughts with, &#8220;Yes&mdash;you
<i>are</i> the woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had her shoulders in his grasp now
and was looking down at her with an expression
of sheer amazement, mingled with
a tenderness that sent a thrill and a hot
wave of&mdash;yes, of delight&mdash;through her.
This man&mdash; She, Eleanor Clearwater,
tolerate the touch of this man and&mdash;<i>delight</i>
in it!</p>

<p>&#8220;That is absurd!&#8221; she cried hysterically.
She looked at him with pleading eyes.
&#8220;Let me go&mdash;please.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted his hands from her shoulders.
Then&mdash;how it happened she never could
understand&mdash;she, trying to draw back, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
drawn forward&mdash;into his arms&mdash;had been
kissed by him&mdash;was in a whirl of joy, of
terror, of wonder, of disbelief in the reality
of what was happening. She, who prided
herself on never having allowed any man to
be in the least familiar with her&mdash;she in
the arms of this bucolic person whom she
hardly knew. It was impossible&mdash;it was
insane.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please let me go,&#8221; she said feebly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the matter with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was holding her at arm&#8217;s length again&mdash;this
powerful man, with the compelling
eyes&mdash; If only he would not look at her so,
she might recover herself. He was saying
in the sweetest, tenderest voice she had ever
heard:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i>&mdash;for <i>me</i>! It simply can&#8217;t be, Miss
Clearwater.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some woman will care for you&mdash;as I
told you,&#8221; she said in a breathless way. &#8220;But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
not I. You told me once you wouldn&#8217;t have
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t know you then,&#8221; replied
he. &#8220;Now&mdash;I&#8217;ve <i>got</i> to have you!&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a cry of dismay. &#8220;Oh&mdash;don&#8217;t
say that&mdash;please!&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure
you don&#8217;t want me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want you,&#8221; confessed he,
frankly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what on earth I&#8217;m
going to do with you. How can you break
with your father and everybody and go
tracking off into poverty with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As for that,&#8221; began she, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got something
of my own, and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped short in horror. What was
she saying? Who was talking out of her
mouth and with her voice? She covered
her face with her hands. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean it&mdash;I&#8217;m
mad&mdash;crazy!&#8221; And she was in his
arms, with him caressing her hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want me,&#8221; he said gently,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
&#8220;and I don&#8217;t want you. But it looks as if
we&#8217;d got to&mdash;doesn&#8217;t it, Ellen?&#8221;</p>

<p>If there had been any abbreviation of her
name that she detested more than any and
all others, it had been Ellen. Yet now&mdash;in
this absurd, lunatic dream she was having,
she liked Ellen&mdash;in his voice. It
seemed to be the name she had been waiting
for, the name her man would brand upon
her. Ellen. No longer Eleanor Clearwater,
but just Ellen&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p>She laughed hysterically. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you
didn&#8217;t select Ella instead,&#8221; said she. &#8220;No
doubt I&#8217;d have accepted it, but I&#8217;d always
have felt low.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were looking at each other in a
dazed way. At the sound of voices and
laughter in the hall, both started and the
crimson of shame deepened and deepened
on Miss Clearwater&#8217;s cheeks and neck and
shoulders. They faced the others with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
every sign of confusion and guilt, neither
daring to look at the other. He stammered
out phrases of departure and left, still with
not a glance at her. Sayler decided that he
had made an absurd premature proposal
and had been sent about his business&mdash;&#8220;When
he might have had her if he&#8217;d kept
after her with a firm tread.&#8221;</p>

<p>Out in the cold winter night, George
strode along until he was half way to his
hotel. Then he paused and addressed the
stars, reeling with silent laughter!</p>

<p>&#8220;What a damn fool I&#8217;ve made of myself!&#8221;</p>

<p>Another man might have said, &#8220;What a
fool she made of me!&#8221; But George Helm
was no self-excuser, no shifter of responsibilities.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve got to put it through,&#8221; he went
on, still speaking aloud but addressing the
dim landscape in the horizon of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
towered the Capitol. &#8220;And since I&#8217;ve got
to do it, I&#8217;ll do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>A damn fool!&mdash;to take upon his already
too heavily burdened shoulders this extra
weight of a woman&mdash;and just the kind of
woman who could be heaviest, most useless.</p>

<p>However, instead of walking with bent
shoulders, he strode along, shoulders erect.
And presently he was whistling like a boy
in a pasture.</p>

<small>THE MATCH-MAKER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MEN&mdash;and women&mdash;who restrain
sentiment to an obscure, uneffectual
part in their own lives
take enormous interest in it everywhere else.
They have melting eyes and troublesome
noses and throats at sentimental plays.
They give to street beggars and patronize
the literature of slop. They are assiduous
matchmakers and want every one&mdash;except
their own sons and daughters&mdash;to marry for
love alone.</p>

<p>There was not a little of this in the composition
of Harvey Sayler, the interesting
boss of the Middle West&mdash;more interesting
than the ordinary purely commercial boss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
because he was at heart a bold and reckless
gambler, one who had less interest in the
stakes than in the game. He was in a sentimental
mood about George Helm and
Eleanor Clearwater. George Helm, the
lean and lank, countrified new orator whom
Sayler&#8217;s secret lieutenant, the Democratic
state boss Hazelrigg, had discovered in the
State Senate; Eleanor Clearwater, heiress
to the notorious&mdash;that is, famous&mdash;lumber
king and Senator, a lady to her finger tips,
fond of playing with &#8220;fine ideas&#8221; of all
kinds, but helplessly dependent upon the
culture and the luxury that can be got only
by acts which proceed from anything but
&#8220;fine ideas.&#8221; A love affair, an engagement,
a marriage between these two appealed to
Sayler&#8217;s love of the sentimentally romantic.</p>

<p>Also, Sayler had a streak of sardonic
humor in him. He liked the mischievous
pranks of fate&mdash;with the persons and property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
and destiny of others. And it seemed
to him that the coming together of these
two would be one of fate&#8217;s masterpieces at
the practical joke. And how old Clearwater,
the risen from farm hand, the intoxicated
aristocrat, the unending snob, would
rage and rave!</p>

<p><i>Also</i>&mdash;and this was the most important
of all, for Sayler never did anything that
wasn&#8217;t a move in his game&mdash; Also&mdash;he
wanted George Helm.</p>

<p>For purposes that need not here be gone
into, Sayler had ordered the Democrats to
make a furious assault upon his prot&eacute;g&eacute; and
ally and master, the plutocracy. Hazelrigg,
obeying orders, had selected Helm to lead
the attack, because Helm was about the only
available man not publicly suspected of
crookedness and hypocrisy, was an earnest,
sincere and effective speaker, shrewd and
sane. After Sayler heard Helm speak,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
Hazelrigg hunted him up at the University
Club. Those clubs to which men of all political
faiths can and do belong are most
useful for meetings of this sort. Said
Hazelrigg:</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think of him, Senator?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of Helm?&#8221; said Sayler. A non-committal
smile&mdash;and that was all.</p>

<p>&#8220;A dangerous man, I&#8217;d say,&#8221; proceeded
Hazelrigg. &#8220;He looks like a farmer and
he&#8217;s homely as a horse. But there&#8217;s nothing
of the jay about that brain of his. And
how he does wake up, and wake things up,
when he gets that lanky form of his straight
on his big feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler smiled again. He was a loquacious
man, like all men of abounding mentality
All lakes that are copiously fed must
copiously overflow. But he had the big
man&#8217;s usual false reputation for taciturnity.
He was never anything but silent, or at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
most terse, with understrappers. That
sort of cattle had to be dealt with carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s doing what I asked him to do, too
damn well,&#8221; said Hazelrigg. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to
choke him off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler, however, was resolved to give his
clients of the plutocracy a thoroughgoing
scare. Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, why not let him alone for the present,
Hazelrigg?&#8221; Sayler was one of those
who give orders in the form of interrogative
suggestions.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he makes me nervous,&#8221; objected the
Democratic boss. &#8220;He&#8217;s spreading like
wildfire. I may have to nominate him for
governor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; said Sayler. A sentimental
smile; he was thinking of the &#8220;match.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;damn it, he&#8217;d likely be elected.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;a good beating might do my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
party a world of good. We&#8217;ve been in too
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t get any <i>hold</i> on
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler deigned no answer but a satirical
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d probably make four years of
merry hell. A governor can do a lot in this
state. He can <i>do</i>; so he doesn&#8217;t dare talk
without doing, like most governors.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d make a good governor,&#8221; said Sayler.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;if I could get some <i>hold</i> on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler&#8217;s eyes were amused. Said he&mdash;and
he had the habit of being intensely relevant
while seeming to be most irrelevant:</p>

<p>&#8220;Curious jaw, that young fellow&#8217;s got.
Did you notice how long it is from ear to
chin? There&#8217;s a foolish notion about that&mdash;a
long chin is a sign of strength. It means
nothing&mdash;nor does a short chin. It&#8217;s the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
length of the jaw that makes persistence&mdash;endurance&mdash;and
the unafraidness that
advances without a tremor where even
courage hesitates. An interesting young
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hazelrigg had never heard so long&mdash;or
so puzzling&mdash;a speech from his secret chieftain.
He said desperately:</p>

<p>&#8220;I give you fair warning, Senator, he may
make it damned interesting for <i>us</i> if we
aren&#8217;t careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler laughed pleasantly. &#8220;I wish he
would. I&#8217;m tired of fighting mere cranks&mdash;or
knaves attacking us simply to shake us
down. Why is it, Hazelrigg, that the best
can be changed into the worst? To find an
absolutely abandoned woman, don&#8217;t look
among the girls from the lower classes.
Find one born a lady, bred a lady. To get a
chap who&#8217;ll swallow any insult with gusto,
who&#8217;ll do any kind of dirty work with pleasure&mdash;go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
among the fallen gentlemen. Several
in this club.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler strolled away. Hazelrigg was
laughing&mdash;uncomfortably. He said to
himself, &#8220;Well, if the Senator was rapping
me, he was banging his own conk,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler had brought Helm and Miss
Clearwater together at his house the night
before&mdash;had arranged it as soon as their
chance meeting in his presence had revealed
to his shrewd eyes that there was something
peculiar in their relations, something
unwarranted by so casual an acquaintance
as theirs apparently had been. And when,
after he had seen to it that they were left
alone together, he had found them in a
state of nervousness that indicated anything
but a smooth session, he had decided
that Helm had made the mistake of proposing
too precipitately&mdash;and had been refused.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
He now went down to the Capitol to hunt
Helm up.</p>

<p>An extraordinary amount of trouble for
so distinguished a man to take about an almost
obscure youth of rugged appearance,
one he knew hardly at all. But Sayler was
a profound man. It had been said of him
that he had ruined more young men than
any man of his time. It was his habit to
seek out any youth who showed, to his
acute insight into human nature, indications
of unusual abilities. As there are not
many such under our system of crushing in
infancy or near it, all but a very few of the
very strongest or luckiest, he had plenty of
time left over for his other affairs. When
he had won the personal liking of such a
young man, he proceeded to show him&mdash;by
ways of most delicate subtlety&mdash;how wise
and sensible and just it was for a man of
ambition to come in with the triumphant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
classes, and not let any academic sentimentality
attach him to the lost and hopeless
and morally doubtful cause of the
masses.</p>

<p>For a few years Sayler had drawn about
himself, had drawn to the support of his
policy of the earth for the strong and the
sly, scores of the brightest young men of the
Middle West. They served him well. They
imbibed his genial philosophy of mingled
generosity and cynicism. And in exchange
for the support and the power they gave
him, he gave them office and money and
fame. He regarded himself as a benefactor.
His young men regarded him as a benefactor.
Only cranks denounced him as a
procurer and a rake of the vilest description.</p>

<p>He had seen great possibilities in this big,
unformed, young state senator, with the
gift for eloquent clear statement and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
the voice and the eyes that captivated. He
purposed to be his benefactor.</p>

<p>Helm was alone in one of the committee
rooms, absorbed in the agitated composition
of a letter. There were all the obvious
signs that much time and paper were
being consumed in vain. Sayler paused a
moment to look well at his proposed next
&#8220;victim,&#8221; as the cranks would have put it.
That long, lean, powerful form, uncouth
yet curiously graceful&mdash;and somehow so intensely
magnetic! That huge, rough-looking
head, the strong features, the out-door
skin. But Sayler saw only the superb line
of the head, the long reach of the jaw.
Said he to himself: &#8220;This fellow <i>looks</i>
more worth getting than any I&#8217;ve ever tried
for.&#8221;</p>

<p>He advanced and laid his hand on
Helm&#8217;s shoulder. Said he, as Helm looked
up, startled:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take a great liberty with
you, Helm. I&#8217;m somewhat older&mdash;but not
old enough to be out of your class. And
I&#8217;m a friend of&mdash;of <i>hers</i>&mdash;and I want to be
a friend of yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>The color flooded poor George&#8217;s face.
He did not know what to do. The man-and-woman
game was as strange to him as
sailor life to the plainsman. And Sayler
had adroitly leaped over the barrier of
sensitiveness which Helm had begun to
build about his inmost self as soon as he
had begun to talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;re writing to her,&#8221; proceeded
the frank and simple Sayler, &#8220;and
I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s something foolish. The thing
to do is to go and face her. She&#8217;s leaving
this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-day!&#8221; exclaimed Helm, puzzled.
&#8220;She said last night she was staying a
week.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>&#8220;She&#8217;s leaving&mdash;because of you. When
a woman thinks highly enough of a man to
fly from him, all he needs do to get her is
run her down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s leaving?&#8221; said Helm. He began
to tear up the paper. &#8220;Leaving on my account.&#8221;
He gave a laugh of relief. &#8220;Then
it&#8217;s all settled, and I don&#8217;t need to write.&#8221;
He tore the paper into little bits and sent
them to join the mass of similar little bits
in the basket. &#8220;Evidently she got her head
back this morning&mdash;just as I did. I wonder
what there is about night time that makes
people so excited and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And courageous,&#8221; said Sayler. &#8220;I wish
I&#8217;d had the daring to do the things the
night has urged me to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm shook his head laughingly. &#8220;The
night&#8217;s insane, the day&#8217;s sane,&#8221; retorted he.
&#8220;I went crazy last night, Mr. Sayler. I&#8217;ve
got so little that I have to skimp to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
along at all&mdash;and my prospects of any more
money are mighty poor, I can tell you.&#8221;
With a humorous twinkle, &#8220;You see, I&#8217;m
not on your side&mdash;the buttered side. I&#8217;m
on the other side where there isn&#8217;t any
butter. Anyhow, I&#8217;ve no use for a wife&mdash;especially
such a wife as that sort of a
woman would be. And she&mdash; Why, she
wouldn&#8217;t want me as a husband if I was the
last man on earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said Sayler. &#8220;Under all
that trumpery flummery she&#8217;s just a woman,
and wants what any other woman wants&mdash;a
<i>man</i>. And I think, my friend, that you
come pretty near to sizing up to that description.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She don&#8217;t want me, nor I her,&#8221; insisted
Helm. &#8220;It was nothing but plain lunacy,
my asking her to marry me and her accepting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler was so astounded that he almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
betrayed himself. His eyes sparkled sentimentally,
and he gave the younger man a
resounding clap on the shoulder. Why, the
conquest was as good as made! &#8220;She
accepted you, Helm, because she wants you.
Last night she knew her real mind. By daylight,
she&#8217;s full of&mdash;of all sorts of pitiful
fears. Go save her, Helm. Go to her. As
soon as she&#8217;s told her father, and he begins
to fight you, everything&#8217;s safe. I know her.
She isn&#8217;t a quitter, and her father will say
things that will make her wild with rage&mdash;and
with love for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time neither of these men, drawn
together by their many traits of mind and
character in common, had the slightest
sense of strangeness. They felt like old
friends. Helm said:</p>

<p>&#8220;But <i>I</i> don&#8217;t want <i>her</i>, Sayler. I&#8217;ve got
no money for her&mdash;no time for her&mdash;no
place for her.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>&#8220;You love her&mdash;don&#8217;t you?&#8221; said Sayler
audaciously.</p>

<p>Helm slowly collapsed into one of his
uncouth poses.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see&mdash;you do. That means&mdash;what?
Why, that you&#8217;ve got to have her. A man
of your sort is no good with a thing like that
unsettled.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm reflected. &#8220;No,&#8221; he finally said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve put her out of my mind before, and I
can do it again. Whenever I don&#8217;t want to
think of anything, I get together so many
other things to worry about that there isn&#8217;t
room or time to worry about it. She&#8217;s
flying. Let her fly. That settles it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you tell me you proposed to
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that she accepted you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s all over,&#8221; said Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;By no means,&#8221; declared the adroiter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
man. &#8220;She has given you her promise. She
will say nothing because she will not wish
to hurt you. But she&#8217;ll keep to her promise
until you release her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm looked dismal. &#8220;Is that the way
those things are managed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll ruin her life, Helm. You&#8217;ve got
to go to her&mdash;like a man. Don&#8217;t do a cowardly
thing&mdash;such as silence, or writing a
foolish note. Face her. It&#8217;s the only square
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>And to Helm it seemed so. He groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along. I&#8217;ll go with you, and see
that you and she have a chance for an undisturbed
talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a minute. I want to think.&#8221;
Helm went to the window and stared out
into the capitol grounds. Sayler seated
himself, lit a cigar and read a newspaper.
Never had cake of his been spoiled by messing
at the baking but unbaked dough.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
Helm took much more than the one minute
he had asked for. When he turned, it was
to say with the composure of a man under
control:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Sayler&mdash;you&#8217;ve done me a
good turn. I am nothing of a lady&#8217;s man.
If you hadn&#8217;t interfered, I&#8217;d have done
something that as you say would have been
contemptible. I&#8217;m ready when you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rarely is there a successful man&mdash;even
the crude seeker of petty power rising to
foreman of the gang of laborers&mdash;who has
not, however tough his skin or hide may
seem to be, a supersensitive nervous system,
more acute than that of ordinary men
and women, though they may pretend to
the most delicate sensitiveness. Sayler was
as sensitive as he seemed phlegmatic. He
never failed to sense the mood of the person
he was with. Therefore, he dropped the
subject of Eleanor and talked speeches.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>Helm, another man of that same acute
sensibility, responded as if he had no concern
in the world beyond discussion of how
speeches should be worked up and delivered.
Sayler, deeply interested in the subject
and in the man, led him on to describe
his own method, this so sympathetically&mdash;rather
than adroitly&mdash;that Helm took from
his pocket an old letter on the blank side of
whose single sheet he had outlined the
&#8220;backbone&#8221; of a speech he was to make
against a perpetual grant of a big trolley
franchise. The franchise meant, of course,
the creation of a huge mass of stocks and
bonds which would enable many generations
of a certain group of the upper class
to live luxuriously by taking impudent toll
from the masses in exchange for no service
rendered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall take up the franchise in a series
of speeches,&#8221; explained Helm. &#8220;In each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
speech I&#8217;ll make one point and only one.
That&#8217;s always my method. If you want to
dazzle a crowd, you make a speech full of
good points. But if you want to convince
them, you take one point and drive it home
with a succession of blows, all on the head
of that same nail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler nodded. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you let me see
that &#8216;backbone&#8217; as you call it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nail is a better name,&#8221; said Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nail for the lid of the coffin of the trolley
franchise grab,&#8221; said Sayler.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; rejoined Sayler.</p>

<p>Helm gave him the sheet of paper and
Sayler read in Helm&#8217;s minute hand this
series of notes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Luxurious idlers.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen. The more of them
we have the poorer we become.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>Proof:</p>

<p><i>Comfort</i> means wealth and leisure to enjoy&mdash;that
is, comfort in the lady and gentleman&#8217;s
sense of the word.</p>

<p>Leisure to enjoy means little or no labor.</p>

<p>But wealth can be created only by laboring;
wealth is nothing but the proceeds of
labor.</p>

<p>Therefore,</p>

<p>To have <i>comfort</i>, in the lady and gentleman
sense, in the sense in which our new
luxury-mad upper class is determined to
have it, means that one must &#8220;appropriate&#8221;&mdash;that
is, steal&mdash;the proceeds of the labor of
others.</p>

<p>First corollary: That the more &#8220;comfortable&#8221;
the upper class becomes, the more
of the proceeds of the labor of others it
must be stealing.</p>

<p>Second corollary: Since the amount of
labor a man can do is necessarily limited by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
his strength, then the more of the proceeds
of his labor is stolen from him, the less there
is left for him and the worse off he becomes.</p>

<p>General conclusion: The more ladies and
gentlemen we have, the harder we must
work and the poorer we must become.</p>
</div>

<p>Sayler read this document through twice.
Then he handed it back to Helm. He was
smiling cynically to himself. Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;Q. E. D. But&mdash;why did you show it to
<i>me</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm&#8217;s gaze rested gravely upon that of
the plutocratic chieftain for the Middle
West. He replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that you want to be friends with
me. Why, I don&#8217;t know. I am willing&mdash;more
than willing to be friends with you.
But I want you to have no delusions. I
want you to know just where I stand&mdash;where
I shall <i>always</i> stand.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; lied Sayler, with a generous
manliness that half fooled himself. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not a zealot like you. I don&#8217;t believe in
men, in human nature. I think progress
comes through the fierce struggle of brutality
and cunning against the stupid shiftlessness
and indolence of mankind. I admit
there are arguments for another view. They
happen not to convince me. But, believing
as I do, I am more interested in the game
than in principles. To me it is simply a
game. And so, I like to see good players
on both sides. I&#8217;d hate to have you come
over to our side. God knows, your side is
badly enough off for good players.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm&#8217;s smile put into his rugged face a
touch of fanaticism&mdash;as tremendous earnestness
is called in these days when to be
interested in anything but accumulation and
appetite is regarded as eccentric. Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;My side, as you call it, doesn&#8217;t need any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
players at all. It is simply&mdash;to change the
figure&mdash;the irresistibly sweeping current. I
am swimming with it, you against it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler surprised him by saying reflectively:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of that. Sometimes I believe
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The right thing&mdash;the thing that&#8217;s in accord
with progress,&#8221; said Helm, &#8220;doesn&#8217;t
need champions. The rainstorm doesn&#8217;t
need umbrellas. But the men who&#8217;ve got to
go out in it&mdash;they do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler was admiring Helm&#8217;s manner. It
was not the manner of the condemned man&mdash;at
least, if it was, it was that of a condemned
man of the type that tranquilly accepts
the inevitable. Yet Sayler knew that
Helm was moving consciously toward one
of those crises that put the souls of men to
the cruelest test. Sayler understood him
thoroughly now, understood the strong and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
tenacious emotions that lay hid, or rather
lay unexposed to any but expert eyes, beneath
the surface look of the homely provincial
man&mdash;provincial now, rather than bucolic,
as he had been when he first burst
upon the astonished and amused town of
Harrison, with his strange red beard, and
his much-tailed cheap broadcloth. &#8220;How
this man could love a cause or a woman!&#8221;
thought the sentimental overlord
of bosses and machines. &#8220;But,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;neither is appreciative&mdash;or worth loving.&#8221;</p>

<p>Where Sayler fell short of greatness was
in that near-sightedness which prevented
him from seeing the big truths that dominate
the horizon of life&mdash;such truths as that
the high happiness is not of the give-and-take
variety but is the capacity for sheer
giving. The deep and serene joy of Helm,
secure from all surface storms, was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
possession of a nature capable of <i>giving</i>.</p>

<p>Helm had not accomplished his only object.
He had simply convinced Sayler of
his value, not in the least of his inflexibility.
Sayler prided himself on thorough knowledge
of human nature. Convictions were,
in his opinion, merely the creatures of circumstances.
Change Helm&#8217;s circumstances,
change his outlook upon the world from the
uncomfortable to the comfortable, and he
would become a tower of strength for the
existing order, for the guardianship of the
masses by the upper class&mdash;a service for
which the masses ought to be glad to
pay with part of their only asset, their
labor.</p>

<p>At the suburban house he had taken for
that legislature session, Sayler put Helm&mdash;not
into the library; he was too tactful to
make such a blunder as to give him the
reminiscent surroundings of the previous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
evening&mdash;but into a home-like little smoking-room,
next to the billiard room. Then
he went in search of Eleanor.</p>

<p>Not often is a man able to gratify so
many widely differing tastes as was Sayler
by bringing together Helm and Eleanor. It
pleased his natural amiability, his sentimentality,
his love of mischief, his passion
for political scheming, his impatience with
the pompous and wearisome pretensions of
her father, and several other minor tastes.
Perhaps, as he entered the upstairs sitting-room
where Eleanor was giving orders to
her maid, amiability was uppermost in his
mind. Amiability was one of his strongest
traits; it is always a strong trait in the characters
of politicians, and expands with use
and with pretense. Said he when the maid
had gone:</p>

<p>&#8220;George Helm is down stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before she could control herself, she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
betrayed herself by looking wildly round to
escape.</p>

<p>Sayler ignored and went tranquilly on:</p>

<p>&#8220;I told him I was sure you&#8217;d be glad to
see him. I know what a good judge of character
you are. You must have seen what a
remarkable man he is&mdash;about the strongest
I&#8217;ve come across, among the younger men.
He&#8217;ll be nominated for governor next fall&mdash;and
elected, I suspect. And he&#8217;ll go
up&mdash;and up. <i>There&#8217;s</i> the sort of man you
ought to marry, Eleanor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to marry <i>anybody</i>,&#8221; cried
she with the pettish anger of a child.</p>

<p>Sayler made mental note of this sign of
nervous tension, and proceeded:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are always saying that a husband
who had already arrived would be uninteresting
in comparison with one who had the
makings of a career in him, and whom the
wife could help&mdash;could work with, and go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
up with. Here&#8217;s your chance&mdash;and as good
a one as ever was offered a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor was listening&mdash;was looking at
the wily schemer with wistful eyes. &#8220;You&#8217;re
not joking?&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m disappointed in you,&#8221; said Sayler.
&#8220;You&#8217;re not so big or so clever as I fancied.
You&#8217;re just ordinary woman, after
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor blushed, and her eyes sank.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were big enough to see
<i>him</i>,&#8221; proceeded Sayler. &#8220;But you saw only
what you shallow women are able to see&mdash;the
fit of his clothes, the absence of a valet,
the lessons in manners he has yet to learn
and will learn soon enough. You don&#8217;t
want the man with the career to make. You
want the ready-made man. You want to
have nothing to do but shine by his light,
be his trivial ornament and plaything. Oh,
you women!&#8221; He laughed with good-humored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
mockery. &#8220;What frauds you are&mdash;and
how little you count for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am engaged to him,&#8221; said Eleanor
quietly&mdash;with a look that ludicrously mingled
pride and fear and apology.</p>

<p>Sayler shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;An impulse
you&#8217;ve repented,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I must have been crazy,&#8221; said
she.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think <i>he</i> must have been crazy,&#8221; retorted
Sayler. &#8220;But he has come to his
senses. He&#8217;s here to release you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor&#8217;s eyes flashed.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was caught for the moment by your
looks,&#8221; Sayler went on, with quick raillery.
&#8220;But he is too intelligent to be ruled by
such an impulse. Shallow men are, but not
such men as George Helm. They assign
women their proper place in the life of a
man with something to do in the world and
the ability to do it.&#8221; Sayler&#8217;s raillery veered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
to a sarcasm none the less stinging for its
cloak of politeness and good humor. &#8220;<i>You</i>
sized <i>him</i> up&mdash;and accepted him. As soon
as <i>he</i> sized <i>you</i> up&mdash;you under the glamor
of that charming exterior of yours and that
very deceptive cleverness&mdash;as soon as he saw
<i>you</i>, he wanted to release you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s beautiful face, frankly expressing
her emotions, gave Sayler the pleasure
of delighting in his skill as a player upon
that interesting instrument, human nature.
A woman&mdash;especially a young woman&mdash;brought
up in the false education custom
imposes upon our comfortable classes,
rarely has the intelligence clearly to distinguish
a formable man in his early formative
period. Or, if her woman&#8217;s instinct
for the real thing in manhood does by
chance lead her aright, the courage to act
is lacking. Eleanor had seen the man in
George Helm&mdash;a degree, a kind even, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
manliness which she recognized as unique.
But she had acted upon, had yielded to only
his peculiar, his irresistible physical charm
for her. Who, looking at his rough and
rugged exterior and hers so fine and delicate,
would have suspected the possibility of
the existence of such a charm? She would
not have admitted to any one&mdash;least of all
to herself&mdash;that the male exterior that best
pleased her was not the &#8220;polished gentleman,&#8221;
the flower of culture, but one exactly
its opposite&mdash;primitive, rough of skin, direct
and crude of manner. If Helm had
been brutal she would have loathed him.
But he was so gentle and tender&mdash;and what
wonderful eyes, and what a magic voice!</p>

<p>Sayler laughed to himself. Here again
was an instance of a phenomenon he amused
himself by observing as he strolled through
life. Time spent by a man in primping to
catch a woman, unless she had been thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
vulgarized and snobified, was time
wasted. He would better have spent it on
training his voice.</p>

<p>Said Eleanor: &#8220;Of course I&#8217;ll release
him. I was going to write him from home.
Do you think I&#8217;d best see him? Won&#8217;t I
spare him pain&mdash;&#8221; She flushed, as Sayler
began to smile&mdash;&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that he especially
cares about me. Simply that he&#8217;ll
be terribly embarrassed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if you&#8217;re <i>afraid</i>,&#8221; said Sayler, &#8220;you
can send down some excuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be cowardly,&#8221; said Eleanor
promptly, &#8220;and insulting to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s in the little room off the billiard
room,&#8221; said Sayler, departing.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, it was not Helm but
Eleanor who was embarrassed when they
were face to face. Her lips were burning&mdash;the
lips he had kissed so tenderly yet so
passionately. What a strong, simple <i>man</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
of a man! If she had given way to her impulse,
she would have burst out crying and
flung herself into those long arms of his
that had seemed to enfold her against all
the ills of life. She could not meet the
gentle, sad look those magnetic eyes of his
bent upon her.</p>

<p>Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Clearwater, I&#8217;ve come to do what
I know you want me to do. I&#8217;ve come to
release you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said stammeringly,
without looking up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what possessed me. I took
advantage of&mdash;of your kindness and liking.
I hope you&#8217;ll forgive me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you didn&#8217;t mean what you said,&#8221;
murmured she, meaning nothing but simply
trying to prevent a painful silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re mistaken there, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;I spoke from my heart. I love you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
very dearly. I don&#8217;t see how I&#8217;m going to
get along without you. There&#8217;s only one
thing in the world that&#8217;d be harder.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was looking at him now&mdash;was looking
at his rugged, kind face&mdash;the face of a
man born to suffer and born to bear without
crying out. Such a lonely man&mdash;one of
those large, simple, lonely souls. Said she:</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant what I said too. Just as much
as you did. But&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;didn&#8217;t mean to
hurt you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t hurt me, Miss Clearwater,&#8221;
protested he earnestly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve done me
only good&mdash;given me only happiness. I&#8217;ll
always remember&mdash;last night&mdash;and it&#8217;ll
make me happy. I oughtn&#8217;t to have said
what I did about your letting me take advantage
of your liking. It wasn&#8217;t the
truth, and I knew it. You are honest and
good&mdash;and what you did was from the
heart.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>&#8220;As nothing I ever did before,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you know as well as I do, that the
hardest thing of all would be for us to be
together. We ain&#8217;t in any way suitable to
each other. You&#8217;re too fine and delicate
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t say that sort of thing,&#8221;
cried she. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t like you&mdash;those snobbish
ideas.&#8221;</p>

<p>A puzzled expression came into his face.
Then he smiled slightly. &#8220;You misunderstood,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean exactly that.
I meant that you hadn&#8217;t been brought up
right&mdash;according to my notion. So&mdash;you&#8217;d
be miserable as my wife, and a burden on
me. Anyhow, it always seemed to me that
I wasn&#8217;t made to be a married man. The
ladies never seemed to care much about me,
and I guess that got me into the way of arranging
to get along without them.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he stood there, rugged and powerful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
his sincere face made tragic by the look of
lonely melancholy that was habitual to it in
repose, she was so moved that she knew she
ought not to trust herself to speak. But she
did&mdash;and her voice was shaking with sobs
as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I know I&#8217;m not worthy of you. I&#8217;m so
poor that I haven&#8217;t anything that you need.
I&#8217;m only fit for a very inferior sort of man.
Oh, how vain and silly I&#8217;ve been&mdash;to imagine
I was worth a man&#8217;s while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I didn&#8217;t mean <i>that</i>&mdash;not at all,&#8221;
cried he. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how to talk to
women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed you don&#8217;t!&#8221; retorted she. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t understand them, at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see I&#8217;ve offended you, Miss Clearwater.
I didn&#8217;t mean to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Don&#8217;t</i> call me Miss Clearwater,&#8221; cried
she desperately. He had not moved, but she
had&mdash;unconsciously&mdash;drawn much nearer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
to him&mdash;almost within his reach. &#8220;And
don&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221; with a hysterical little laugh&mdash;&#8220;<i>don&#8217;t</i>
call me ma&#8217;am.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled with a kind of grim humor.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that it matters what I call you,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;as long as I can&#8217;t call you mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>She trembled. &#8220;Oh, <i>won&#8217;t</i> you understand?&#8221;
cried she. And she looked at him
with eyes shining with passion.</p>

<p>He shook his head slowly. &#8220;Well&mdash;I
must be going.&#8221; With a sudden change to
a look of terrific power. &#8220;If I stay here a
minute longer, I&#8217;ll not be able to keep my
hands off you. I love you, Ellen&mdash;and it&#8217;s
stronger than I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you go?&#8221; said she, boldly.
Her glowing heart told her it was no time
for trifling, for maidenly pretense of coyness.
That sort of game was all very well,
with men who understood it&mdash;and men one
didn&#8217;t especially care about. But this man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
didn&#8217;t understand it&mdash;and he was tremendously
worth-while. Plain speaking, or he
would be lost forever. She did not see how
she was to marry him; but to lose him&mdash;that
would be frightful. &#8220;Why should you
go?&#8221; she said boldly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you want me,
George?&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his hands behind his back. He
grew pale; his eyes seemed deeper set than
ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;No man ever made me feel, but you,&#8221;
she went on. &#8220;I belong to you. If you
cast me off&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He had her in his arms&mdash;not because of
what she had said but because he could
withstand no longer. &#8220;I&#8217;ve gone crazy
again,&#8221; he said, as he kissed her&mdash;as
she kissed him&mdash;&#8220;but you know as well
as I do that we can&#8217;t be anything to each
other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think of that,&#8221; pleaded she.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
&#8220;Let&#8217;s be happy while we can&mdash;and let&#8217;s
hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to hope for,&#8221; said he,
drawing away from her. &#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed of
myself. I love you, but it isn&#8217;t the kind of
love a man gives a woman that he wants
to live his life with.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take me, George,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be
what you want. You can teach me. I&#8217;ll
learn. Don&#8217;t shut affection and love out of
your life. You can&#8217;t be half the man without
them that you&#8217;ll be with them. Oh, you
don&#8217;t understand women. You don&#8217;t know
what women are for&mdash;what a woman is for&mdash;what
your woman is for in your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>The look of resolution had gone; the
look of melancholy had come in its place.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know we can&#8217;t marry right away,&#8221; she
went on. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a lot to do, first. You
are poor in one way, and I in another.
We&#8217;ve got to wait and work.&#8221; She looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
up at him, smiling, pleading, her hand
touching his arm. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s
worth doing, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped to a chair. &#8220;I&#8217;ve fooled myself,&#8221;
he said gloomily. &#8220;I thought I was
coming here to give you up. Instead, I
came to get you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed merrily, her delicate hand
tingling as it touched his shock of hair that
grew in such disorderly fashion yet exactly
suited the superb contour of his head. Said
she:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got what you came for.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled grimly. &#8220;How am I going to
think straight and do what&#8217;s right for both
of us, with you touching me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want me to touch you?&#8221;</p>

<p>With a strong sweeping gesture, he drew
her against him, as she stood beside him,
he sitting.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know we might as well say we&#8217;re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
going to wait for each other,&#8221; proceeded
she. It is astonishing&mdash;and enlightening&mdash;how
well women argue when they wish to.
&#8220;You know we&#8217;ll do it, anyhow. You won&#8217;t
marry any other woman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t but one woman for me,&#8221; said
he, with an accent that thrilled her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think <i>I</i> could let any other man
<i>touch</i> me?&#8221; demanded she.</p>

<p>There was a delightfully ferocious jealousy
in the sudden tightening of the arm
about her waist. He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;re in for it, Ellen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her arm went round his shoulders. Said
she laughingly: &#8220;Women aren&#8217;t so <i>very</i>
hard to understand&mdash;are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>He eyed her shrewdly. &#8220;Not when
they&#8217;re willing to be understood.... You
are <i>sure</i> you want to wait?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve <i>got</i> to,&#8221; replied she,
simply.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>He suddenly stood up, drawing away
from her. She was in a tremor of alarm&mdash;which
was not decreased by his resolute expression,
until he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get to work. I&#8217;ve got to hurry
things. You understand, you&#8217;re entirely
free until I&#8217;m able to come for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it helps you to think so,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;But&mdash;I&#8217;m not that kind of girl,
George.&#8221;</p>

<p>A look of tenderness flooded her and he
said: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean that. Of course you
aren&#8217;t. You&#8217;re&mdash;mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>And she was crying with happiness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sayler understood as soon as he saw her
face. And he felt that he had won. George
Helm, on his way to the triumphant class&mdash;was
it not a fundamental law of human nature
that a human being could not be <i>in</i> a
class without becoming <i>of</i> it, of its ideas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
feelings, attitude toward other classes?
George Helm, marrying a girl of the triumphant
class. Could he, however tenacious,
resist the influences, the subtle influences,
insistent, incessant, unconsciously
exerted, unconsciously yielded to&mdash;the influences
of a loved wife of the triumphant
class from birth?</p>

<p>&#8220;He shall be the next governor of this
state,&#8221; Sayler said to himself; and a smile
more amiably generous than his never glorified
human visage.</p>

<p>Helm saw &#8220;Ellen&#8221; only three times in
the remainder of that week, and then for
but a few minutes. He set to work with an
energy that made his previous toiling seem
a species of languor. He decided that Ellen
had been right when she told him he did
not appreciate the part of woman in the
life of man. And when the legislature adjourned
he went on a tour of the cities and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
towns and villages as a lecturer, and built
for himself that only solid fame&mdash;a personal
fame which future assaults from a
subsidized hostile press could not destroy.
The people would have seen him, heard
him, looked into his eyes, touched his hand.
Sayler, away from the scene, and kept informed
of events by lieutenants with lieutenant-brains,
did not get the true meaning
of Helm&#8217;s tour, but assumed that making a
living was his sole object. However, if
Sayler had known&mdash;had even been able to
read Helm&#8217;s thoughts, he would not have
been disturbed. Circumstances of class-association
had made George Helm what
he was; circumstances of class-association
would re-make him.</p>

<p>Nor was Hazelrigg moved to suspicion
by the enthusiasm with which the boom of
Helm for governor was received, as soon
as launched&mdash;nor by Helm&#8217;s memorable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
campaign&mdash;nor by the overturn on election
day that swept Helm into office by a majority
such as the Democrats had never
dreamed of. In Hazelrigg&#8217;s opinion it was
all clever machine manipulation by Sayler&#8217;s
men of the Republican machine and by
himself and his lieutenants. Helm had
shown himself sensible and manageable in
everything pertaining to the practical side
of the campaign work; Hazelrigg began to
suspect there was a secret understanding between
him and Sayler. &#8220;That man Sayler,&#8221;
said Hazelrigg to himself, with a grin,
&#8220;he&#8217;s a deep one. He&#8217;s the best in the
country at the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm was, of course, at home in Harrison
for the election&mdash;was at Mrs. Beaver&#8217;s
boarding-house, in the attic room still,
though he had nearly thirty-five hundred
dollars, the savings from the lecture tour.
Mrs. Beaver had tried to induce him to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
the best room in the house, at the attic price
if that would be an inducement.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said Helm.
&#8220;I&#8217;m very comfortable. Why should I
move?&#8221;</p>

<p>Many people thought this sticking to his
attic was shrewd politics. It may be that
a desire to show <i>his</i> class that he was still
with them had something to do with his refusal
to move. But the chief, the deciding
reason was the one he gave. He had lived
in that little room long. He had got used
to it. He liked it, felt at home in it, would
have felt strange without it to come home
to and live in. Helm was one of those
men&mdash;and Sayler, had he been entirely
great, would have looked into this before
completing his estimate of his character&mdash;Helm
was of those men&mdash;and there are
women of the same sort&mdash;who care nothing
for luxury, even for the comforts that soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
seem necessary to people who get the smallest
chance to expand.</p>

<p>To him heat and cold were matters of
indifference. He had ploughed and mowed
in the broiling sun; he had slept under thin
covers, with snow sifting through the roof,
had brushed the snow off his skin when he
got ready to rise. He had eaten all kinds of
difficult, not to say impossible, fried food&mdash;and
had not known what he was eating, or
cared. He was so profoundly inured to
hardship that he was unaware of it&mdash;and
was unaware of comfort when he, by chance,
got it. Hardened against hardship; hardened
also against comfort and luxury. That
last peculiarity was probably the most significant
factor in his make-up. Yet no one
had noted it; he himself not only had not
noted it but never would. When one considers
how powerful in effect upon human
character is love of the softer side of life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
and desire for it and clinging to it and respecting
it and its possessors, one begins to
comprehend how far-reaching was the importance
of George Helm&#8217;s unique hardiness.</p>

<p>Eleanor Clearwater was visiting in the
hill top part of Harrison&mdash;was visiting the
Hollisters, where she could stop whenever
she wished, and as long as she wished, without
any one&#8217;s thinking of the matter. Helm&mdash;regarded
with respect by the better class
at Harrison, now that he was so high in
public life&mdash;had arranged to receive the
returns at Hollister&#8217;s. Bart Hollister, without
a suspicion that Eleanor had &#8220;managed&#8221;
him, invited Helm&mdash;and was as
astonished as pleased by his prompt acceptance.
So sweeping was the victory that
his election was conceded by the Republicans
before he finished supper at Mrs.
Beaver&#8217;s.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>&#8220;A governor gets eight thousand a year,
doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221; said Miss Shaler, the sentimental,
be-wigged old maid of the boarding-house
circle. &#8220;You&#8217;ll certainly pick on
some nice girl and be getting married now,
Mr. Helm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Governor</i> Helm,&#8221; corrected Mrs. Beaver,
proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll soon be a Mrs.
Governor Helm,&#8221; said Miss Shaler, with
the soft hysterical giggle with which she
accompanied all her frequent remarks on
the one subject that interested her.</p>

<p>Helm surprised them all&mdash;threw them
into a ferment of curiosity&mdash;by saying with
bold, emphatic, even noisy energy, unbelievable
in so shy a man:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, ma&#8217;am. She and I&#8217;ll be
inaugurated together.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed with a gayety that seemed a
little foolish in a grave governor-elect. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
gave them no chance to devise ways round
the inflexible rule against direct questions
as to that one subject. He rose and went
forth to claim his bride.</p>

<small>SEEING HER FATHER</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ON the second floor of the Washington
house of George Clearwater,
lumber king and United States
Senator, there was a small room whose windows
commanded the entrance. They gave
upon one of those useless and never used
balconies wherewith architects strive to conceal
the feebleness of their imagination and
the poverty of their invention. Of that particular
balcony some facetious congressman
said that Clearwater might one day find it
convenient&mdash;&#8220;when he needs a place to
stand and explain to the mob how he happens
to be so rich.&#8221; The remark got round
to Clearwater, and he never looked at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
little balcony without recalling it. The
multimillionaire, constantly enveloped by
his crowd of sycophants, soon tends to become
paranoiac, soon fancies that everybody
is thinking about him all the time&mdash;about
him and his money, which are one and the
same thing, for he feels that he is his money
and his money he. Also, as his dominant
passion has always been wealth, he assumes
that it is the universal passion raging in all
hearts as firmly as in his; that therefore he
must be the object of malignant envy; that
those myriad eyes ever fixed upon him are
as covetous as his own. Thus Clearwater
took that facetious remark seriously&mdash;read
the distorted tales of the French revolution,
discussed the ferocity and restlessness of the
masses quite as if he had never been a farm
hand, one of those same masses, and had
never known the truth about them&mdash;their
ass-like patience, their worm-like meekness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>He was looking at this balcony and was
thinking of the &#8220;menacing popular unrest&#8221;
when George Helm&#8217;s name was brought up
to him. He was still looking and thinking
when Helm himself entered the small room.
At the sound of his step, Clearwater turned
and greeted him with friendly constraint.
Helm looked wretched with embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;Mr. Helm&mdash;pardon me, Governor
Helm,&#8221; said Clearwater who had long since
effaced all traces of the farm hand and of
the stages intermediate to his arrival at
the American business man&#8217;s heaven, the
plutocracy. &#8220;Much has happened since we
met last winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Much had indeed happened, but the only
blessed thing of it Helm could remember
at the moment was the collar he had been
beguiled into buying that morning. It
was too high for him, and it squeaked. Also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
Helm had on a new suit of clothes; he had
bought it only a few days before. He had
not yet got used to it, but it looked as if he
had slept in it. That was the way clothes
always acted with George&mdash;and being
elected governor had made no change. In
answer to the senator&#8217;s amiable remark he
managed to utter&mdash;with a violent squeak
and creak of the collar&mdash;a timid &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no small honor to be the youngest
governor in the United States,&#8221; pursued
Clearwater. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221;</p>

<p>George looked at him as if &#8220;sit down&#8221;
were a new and puzzling idea to him. Then
he looked about at the furniture as if he
had small and wanting confidence in it.
However, as Clearwater sat, he ventured
a nervous imitation and drew out his handkerchief.</p>

<p>A great misfortune&mdash;no, a fresh calamity.
The handkerchief had been bought with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
the collar. It did not squeak; worse, it
rustled. The collar creaked, the handkerchief
rustled, the new suit caught him under
the arms.</p>

<p>Said Clearwater:</p>

<p>&#8220;My daughter&mdash;Eleanor&mdash;she has&mdash;has
rather prepared me for your visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>George feebly echoed Clearwater&#8217;s amiable
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Senator Sayler, too&mdash;he has put in a
good word for you. He is a great friend
of yours&mdash;a great and generous admirer.
He predicts a future for you&mdash;a dazzling
future.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm began to murmur a reply, but the
catch in his coat seemed somehow to have
involved his vocal cords. He put the rustling
handkerchief away, but in his pocket
it still rustled like a mouse in a waste-paper
basket. Helm&#8217;s murmurings died in a kind
of stifled groan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>&#8220;I am an old-fashioned American,&#8221; continued
Clearwater, passing his hand over his
short gray beard in a pompous gesture as if
this confession reflected the highest credit
upon his courage and upon America. &#8220;I
believe in the love marriage. I am glad my
daughter has chosen&mdash;and has been chosen
by&mdash;a man of the people, a rising, ambitious
man, with a career in the making.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said George.</p>

<p>Clearwater extended a cigar, which
George took&mdash;helped him light it&mdash;lit one
himself. &#8220;A very mild smoke,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;I have Cisneros make it up for
me in Havana from a specially selected leaf.
If you&#8217;d prefer something stronger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; said George.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord Cuffingham&mdash;the British ambassador&mdash;asked
me to let him have a box to
send to the King. Personally I have no
more respect for a king than I have for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
plain American citizen. But we were talking
about your wish to marry my daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said George, a trifle less embarrassed,
now that the cigar relieved him
of worry about his large, very brown and
very powerful hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall confess to you, Governor, that
if it had not been for the generous words
Senator Sayler spoke in your behalf I
should have hesitated about giving my
consent.&#8221;</p>

<p>George forgot his collar, the handkerchief,
the coat&mdash;all his embarrassments.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your speeches in the legislature last
winter&mdash;such report of them as I got&mdash;and
in your campaign&mdash;I must say in all candor,
Governor, that while I appreciate the necessity
of pleasing the people, of soothing
them by seeming to agree with them&mdash;still I
must say that you&mdash;in fact at times you
seemed to go even further than&mdash;than their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
demagogues, in assaults upon property, and
wealth and all that has built up the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm was leaning forward now, his elbows
upon his knees, a fascinating look in
his rugged face, in the kind yet somehow
inflexible, blue-gray eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; continued Clearwater, &#8220;Sayler
assures me that you are a sound, safe
man&mdash;that you have nothing of the demagogue
in you&mdash;that you stand for the fine
old American principle of freedom, of the
utmost opportunity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by opportunity?&#8221;
asked George.</p>

<p>Clearwater frowned slightly. &#8220;I mean&mdash;opportunity,&#8221;
said he, in the tone of one
forbidding further questioning as impertinence.</p>

<p>George settled himself back in his chair
with a long sigh. &#8220;I see that Senator<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
Sayler has been too kind about me,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;He has given you a false impression
of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to hear it,&#8221; said Clearwater
curtly.</p>

<p>His look and his voice were a warning
that Helm would better draw back if he
did not wish to provoke a wrath that had
been not without difficulty soothed by
Sayler and Eleanor. Helm understood.
His eyes had never been kinder or gentler&mdash;or
more direct&mdash;than as he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;There can never be any political sympathy
between you and me, Senator. I
have made my fight thus far along the lines
I believe to be right. I have not said more
than I meant, but less.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearwater rose, rage flaming in his
cheeks. &#8220;I suspected so!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
imagine Sayler&#8217;s object in trying to deceive
me&mdash;to trick me into admitting to my family<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
one of this new breed of dangerous
young demagogues who want to substitute
anarchy and socialism for the republic of
the fathers.&#8221;</p>

<p>He glowered at George, sitting and staring
into space, the look of tragedy, of profound
melancholy strong upon his homely,
gaunt face. He went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;You look like an intelligent man. How
can you fly in the face of your common-sense?
To get office, to lift yourself, you
are willing to rouse the ignorant and the
idle to hate and to assault the men whom
God has raised up to develop and to guard
this country! I was poor myself, and I was
anxious to get up in the world. But I&#8217;d
rather have thrust my right hand into the
fire than have lifted it against my country.&#8221;</p>

<p>George Helm heaved another long sigh,
rose and regarded the old lumber king
sadly. Said he:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t argue with you, sir. We&#8217;d
only get into a wrangle. I simply couldn&#8217;t
allow you to misunderstand about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you come here, at all?&#8221; demanded
Clearwater. &#8220;Did Sayler fool you,
too? Has he been trying to make us both
puppets in some political game of his?
Why should he wish to humiliate me by
tricking me into letting my daughter marry
a demagogue?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm flushed, but his voice was gentle
as he replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re unjust to Senator Sayler,
sir. He knew that your daughter and I
loved each other. He likes both of us, and
he knew you&#8217;d put your daughter&#8217;s happiness
above what he probably regards as simply
a difference of political opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anarchy and socialism aren&#8217;t political
opinions,&#8221; retorted Clearwater. &#8220;They&#8217;re
criminal, sir, criminal. And I regard any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
one who holds the ideas you profess&mdash;I regard
him as a criminal. He <i>is</i> a criminal&mdash;an
inciter of riot and murder and theft.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt you are honest in your opinions,
sir,&#8221; said George with quiet dignity.
&#8220;But I must request you not to insult me
again. I shall detain you only a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t conceive how you dared aspire
to <i>my</i> daughter. Did you think <i>I</i> would
be impressed by your being a governor?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm&#8217;s eyes twinkled humorously.
&#8220;Hardly,&#8221; said he. &#8220;They say that you own
two or three governors. I know Sayler owns
nearly a dozen. No, Senator, I didn&#8217;t come
to you as a public man but just as a chap
who loves your daughter and intends to do
the best he knows how to make her not regret
having married him. You can see for
yourself that I&#8217;m not pretty to look at, and
haven&#8217;t the graces of manner, or any of
those things to recommend me to a lady. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
don&#8217;t know why she&#8217;s willing to take me.
So far as my side of it&#8217;s concerned, of
course, as soon as I saw <i>her</i> I couldn&#8217;t help
wanting her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm was so ingenuous and winning that
in spite of himself Clearwater was mollified
somewhat. &#8220;I guess Sayler&#8217;s responsible
for this,&#8221; said he, with a grudging graciousness.
&#8220;Well&mdash;we&#8217;ve found him out, and
as there&#8217;s no harm done we can laugh at
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to think it over,&#8221; said George, &#8220;I
shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if Sayler didn&#8217;t have
a notion in the back of his head that if he
got me married right I&#8217;d come round&mdash;fall
into line and drop my principles.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearwater nodded. &#8220;And no doubt you
will. But <i>I</i> shall not permit <i>my</i> daughter
to be used for any such purpose.&#8221; Very
graciously, after the manner of the thoroughly
virtuous, praising the feeble and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
halting efforts of a young fellow man essaying
the lower reaches of the path of virtue:
&#8220;I congratulate you on your honesty&mdash;on
not trying the unprincipled game of hiding
your principles. I admire an honest man.
It must have cost you a struggle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said George, &#8220;I had nothing to lose
by speaking out. You are the courageous
one, sir&mdash;for you might have lost your
daughter&mdash;if I had been over sensitive and
had taken up your hot words.&#8221;</p>

<p>Senator Clearwater showed that he was
at a loss to understand. Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate, it&#8217;s all settled. I shall
explain to my daughter. For I must ask
you not to try to see her again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm looked at him vaguely.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would only cause both you and her
pain,&#8221; explained Clearwater.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it will distress us both to disregard
your advice,&#8221; said Helm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>&#8220;My advice?&#8221; inquired the puzzled
Clearwater.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are advising against her marrying
me, as I understand it,&#8221; explained George.
&#8220;Of course, we may be mistaken, but we
can&#8217;t see it that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearwater was so astounded that his
mouth fell open and gave him some difficulty
before it permitted him to say:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;what in the <i>hell</i> do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now look here, Senator,&#8221; remonstrated
Helm, &#8220;what&#8217;s the use of getting excited?
You don&#8217;t want to lose your daughter.
It&#8217;s me you don&#8217;t like. Well&mdash;you need
never see me. I&#8217;ll go away when you visit
our house, and she&#8217;ll visit you whenever she
wants to and leave me behind. Why
shouldn&#8217;t we get along peaceably? She&#8217;s
your only child. She&#8217;s all you&#8217;ve got. It&#8217;ll
grieve her to know she&#8217;s going against your
wishes. Why not make her as easy as you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
can? I don&#8217;t expect you to pretend to like
me. But you can just kind of&mdash;pass me
over. I&#8217;ll help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearwater, warned by a slight vertigo,
had seated himself. Said he slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say, sir, that you think
<i>my</i> daughter will marry you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come now, Senator,&#8221; pleaded
George, &#8220;you know how it was when you
went courting. Would your wife have given
you up, because her father and mother
didn&#8217;t like you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough of this,&#8221; said Clearwater
quietly. He rose. &#8220;I wish you good day,
sir. I wish you to understand that you will
not see my daughter again&mdash;that she will
not marry you&mdash;that if she did I&#8217;d cut her
off without a cent. As you&#8221;&mdash;with scathing
contempt&mdash;&#8220;have no doubt heard, she has
some property of her own. It is very small&mdash;very
small, sir. And I have control of it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
until she is thirty&mdash;time enough to starve
her out and to spare, as she knows&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Senator,&#8221; interrupted George, &#8220;I hope
you won&#8217;t say these things to her. Do them
if you think it right. I shall be glad if you
do, as I don&#8217;t want my wife beholden to
anybody but me. Do them, Senator, but
don&#8217;t let on to her. She might feel that you
didn&#8217;t love her. She might&mdash;I hate to say
it, sir&mdash;she might stop loving you herself, if
she thought you could put money before
love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need no assistance in managing my
family,&#8221; said Clearwater, in cold fury. He
bowed, &#8220;Good day, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm hesitated, then bowed with simple
dignity and withdrew. Clearwater watched
at one of the windows until he saw him
walking slowly out of the grounds and
down the street&mdash;tall and lean, awkwardly
dressed. Said Clearwater aloud with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
angry sneer: &#8220;He looks as if he belonged
at the servants&#8217; entrance.&#8221; The remark was
not without justification, yet Clearwater
knew&mdash;and the knowledge enraged him&mdash;that
there was in the air of that figure, in the
expression of that face, a quality, far removed
from the menial, or even the humble.
And it was that quality that made the arrogant
and confident old man a little nervous
as he awaited the coming of the daughter
for whom he had sent as soon as Helm disappeared
round the corner.</p>

<p>As Eleanor came in, radiant, expectant,
she gave a quick glance round and exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, papa, where&#8217;s George?&#8221;</p>

<p>To &#8220;papa&#8221; George had up to this time
been simply what one man is to another&mdash;simply
a specimen of the male sex. In
this case, not a specimen likely to appeal
strongly to the female sex, according to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
Clearwater&#8217;s notion of female likes and
dislikes in males. But Eleanor&#8217;s look and
tone put a sudden very different complexion
on the matter. Clearwater abruptly realized
that his daughter&mdash;this lovely, delicate
creature of fine manners, speech and raiment&mdash;was
in love with the lanky, baggily-dressed
fellow, half crank, half knave and
altogether detestable.</p>

<p>This discovery, thus all in an instant
made real to the father, instead of angering
him, threw him into a panic. And out of
panic, with its chaos of fermenting emotions,
any emotion is as likely to emerge as
any other. No one, in a panic, can predict
whether he will emerge furious and implacable
or trembling and abject. The reason
for the panic was his adoration of his daughter.
Rarely is there any greater intimacy
between father and daughter than friendly
acquaintance. But almost always there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
a tenacious and worshipful admiration&mdash;which,
naturally, forbids the frankness of
intimacy because each fears that the delusion
of the other would be impaired, if not
destroyed, should the truth of human weakness
come out. The daughter adores the
father as the superior type of the superior
sex; the father adores the daughter as the
embodiment of the female sex&#8217;s two awe-inspiring
charms, beauty and purity. Clearwater
thought his daughter the most beautiful
woman in the world, and an angel for
purity&mdash;certainly, such purity could have
no place in the mud-geyser of the world as
he knew it. And he was now in terror lest
she, idealist, ignorant of the realities, should
not understand his attitude toward Helm.
No doubt the fellow had talked his theories
to her&mdash;and they were just the sort of stuff
that would appeal to idealism and worldly-ignorance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>&#8220;Helm?&#8221; said Clearwater, almost as nervous
as George had been with his squeaking
collar and his rustling handkerchief.
&#8220;Helm? Oh&mdash;he&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I told him to send for me as soon
as you and he had finished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&mdash;that is, he&mdash;&mdash;. Now, Eleanor,
you must trust to my judgment about
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor had an expression different from
any he had seen before&mdash;in her face, in
any one&#8217;s face. &#8220;Father,&#8221; she said in a
voice that made him quail, though it
was neither loud nor in any other obtrusive
way emotional, &#8220;what did you say
to him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was insulting,&#8221; said Clearwater.
&#8220;He insulted me. His presence was an insult.
His ideas are an insult to us both.
Eleanor, he is one of those men who go up
and down the country denouncing me and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
men of my sort&mdash;all the leading men of the
country as robbers, and rousing the passions
of the poor and the ignorant against
us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean he&#8217;s a Democrat and you are
a Republican,&#8221; said Eleanor angrily. &#8220;But
what do I care for that? I can&#8217;t fall in love
with a man because he&#8217;s a Republican,
papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not a Republican, nor a Democrat,&#8221;
declared Clearwater. &#8220;There are
sane, sound men in both parties, and both
are one when it comes to questions like law
and order, respect for the courts&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; interrupted the girl, &#8220;<i>what</i> did
you say to George? Did you send him
away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is an anarchist, a socialist&mdash;a&mdash;a
demagogue. He insulted me. He&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>What</i> did he say?&#8221; she again interrupted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>&#8220;As I&#8217;ve told you, he has attacked me&mdash;my
sort of men&mdash;with lies and filth. He
has&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he say here&mdash;a while ago&mdash;in
this room?&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearwater, thus cornered, dared not
wander too far from the truth. &#8220;He said
plainly that he meant all he had said&mdash;that
he had spoken less than he thought.
He refused to retract or modify. He
was&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How like him!&#8221; cried Eleanor, with
shining eyes. &#8220;Do you wonder that I <i>love</i>
him, papa!&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearwater was taken completely aback.
&#8220;<i>You</i> approving insults to <i>me</i>!&#8221; exclaimed
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know you&#8217;d have despised him if
he had weakened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor, you don&#8217;t understand. This
man&#8217;s conduct is criminal&mdash;is a grave offense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
against society&mdash;is an insult to me&mdash;a
menace to our property&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to scare me, papa,&#8221; laughed
the girl. &#8220;You can&#8217;t. Maybe I don&#8217;t
understand his political principles. What
do I care for them? It&#8217;s a woman&#8217;s business
to love and then to trust. I love him.
So&mdash;whatever he says goes with me, you
foolish old papa.&#8221; And she threw her arms
round his neck and kissed him and mussed
his carefully arranged beard with her
chin.</p>

<p>Clearwater had the shrewd man&#8217;s knowledge
of human nature, was not without
insight into his daughter. It is a mistake
to think that men are fooled because they
let themselves be cajoled; they are fooled,
usually, because they wish to be, because
their vanity or their hope or their affection
gives their cajoler the aid without which
he&mdash;or she&mdash;would fail. Clearwater was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
well aware that Eleanor was artfully dodging
the real issue. But how does knowledge
that his beloved daughter is lovingly artful
aid a loving father to corner her and bring
her to ways of sense and reason?</p>

<p>&#8220;Let my beard alone,&#8221; said Clearwater
fretfully. But no one would have been deceived;
under the fretfulness there was the
male, ashamed of his weakness of affection
for the female&mdash;but none the less weak.</p>

<p>Eleanor laughed and persisted in the
mussing and mauling.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t wheedle me, miss,&#8221; declared
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I can,&#8221; laughed she. &#8220;You
told me I could have him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what kind of man he was.
Now that I know, I forbid it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She kissed him. &#8220;Then I&#8217;ll marry him,
anyhow. I&#8217;ve simply <i>got</i> to do it, papa.
And&mdash;as Mr. Sayler says, if you were running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
for vice-president, or anything, it
would be a good thing to have a man like
George compelled to keep quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;d attack me just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;d do you good. People would
simply think less of him for coming out
against his wife&#8217;s father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not have such a character in my
family,&#8221; cried Clearwater desperately. He
pushed his daughter away. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand
your wanting him. After all the
money that&#8217;s been spent on your education,
all the pains that&#8217;s been taken!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think <i>you&#8217;d</i> look on my education
as a tearing success,&#8221; replied she. &#8220;It
seems to have taught me to appreciate a
man. But the education isn&#8217;t responsible
for that. It&#8217;s because I&#8217;m <i>your</i> daughter.
How could I help despising the men who
couldn&#8217;t do anything for themselves, who
owe everything to others, who live like fleas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
on a dog, papa&mdash;instead of being strong and
rising up and up? Like you, papa!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; exclaimed Clearwater. &#8220;I
never was a demagogue, an inciter of class
hatreds, a fermenter of envy&mdash;telling the
shiftless and thoughtless&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her finger laughingly. &#8220;Now,
papa! Be careful! I&#8217;ve read some of your
early speeches&mdash;when you were running for
Congress and starting unions in the logging
camps.&#8221;</p>

<p>The red, so difficult to bring to old cheeks,
so slow to spread, crept over his whole face.
It is fortunate that his daughter did not
know the whole of the why of that red&mdash;the
deep-hidden story of treason to the people
who had believed in him, of viler preceding
treason to his honester self.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was an ignorant fool in those days,&#8221;
shuffled he. &#8220;And this fellow isn&#8217;t. He&#8217;s
intelligent and cunning.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>She was too wise to linger upon this dangerous
ground of politics, once she had
scored. Away she sped, with a delightfully
crafty, &#8220;I do believe you think he&#8217;s after
my money, father. I can see how you might
think so. And you&#8217;re right to convince
yourself. Yes, I understand. You&#8217;re putting
him to the test. I&#8217;m glad of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; inquired the
puzzled father.</p>

<p>She was laughing gayly. &#8220;Yes&mdash;I see it
all. Go ahead, papa. Oppose all you like.
Make him feel that you will cut me off if
I marry him. I <i>know</i> him. I know he
doesn&#8217;t need that test. But I can&#8217;t blame
you for not trusting him. You see, you
don&#8217;t love him&mdash;yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearwater was dumfounded. To have
his flank thus neatly turned! And that, just
as he was about to deliver the final and decisive
blow&mdash;the threat of cutting her off.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
He gathered himself together as best he
could, whipped up his anger and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;But I shall do that very thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him with sudden, touchingly
sweet incredulity. &#8220;Oh, no&mdash;you
couldn&#8217;t, papa. Not that I&mdash;not that we&mdash;want
anything from you but your love.
But you couldn&#8217;t make a base thing like
money a test of the love between you and
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>His eyes shifted. When a father seriously
makes the threat to cut off a son or a daughter,
however great the reflection upon the
father, it is greater upon the son or daughter.
Eleanor Clearwater had lived under
her father&#8217;s eye all the years of her life. He
knew her&mdash;knew her character&mdash;respected
it, feared it, as baser character ever fears
finer. And stronger than his aversion to the
George Helm sort of man, stronger than
his passion for autocratic rule, stronger even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
than his reverence for his wealth, was&mdash;of
necessity&mdash;his fear lest his daughter should
justly estimate him, should lose her delusion
as to his true nature.</p>

<p>Our conduct is less a measure of ourselves
than of those about us&mdash;those whose opinions
we respect, those of whom we feel the
need. George Clearwater gave up the
struggle. Eleanor had won, not because her
father doted upon her&mdash;for mere doting
readily turns toward hate when its object
offends&mdash;but because he respected her.
Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you marry him, it&#8217;s without my consent.
It&#8217;s against my wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>His tone of gloomy resignation told her
that she had won. She was astonished; for
from time to time there had been in his
voice a note that set her to quivering with
alarm lest she should have to face the alternative
of breaking with him or with George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
Helm. And it seemed to her that in choosing
Helm she would show herself selfish,
unappreciative of all her father had done
for her and would make her love for him
look a poor feeble unmasked pretense. Said
she demurely:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll let us marry here?&#8221;</p>

<p>He made an angry gesture. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want a scandal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You being rich,&#8221; she went on adroitly,
&#8220;a story that you were snobbish would be
put out, if we married anywhere else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care a damn what people think
or say,&#8221; retorted he so violently that she
knew her shot had penetrated.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I do,&#8221; replied she. &#8220;I want you to
be vice-president, and I&#8217;d hate to be even
indirectly the cause of anything that might
interfere. You remember, Mr. Sayler said
my marrying George Helm would make
you more attractive as a candidate.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>&#8220;You weren&#8217;t thinking of marrying anyways
soon!&#8221; cried he, angry and alarmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;George wants us to be inaugurated
together. He goes in the first of January.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearwater began to pace the room with
quick, nervous steps. &#8220;That means right
away,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, papa. In about two weeks.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stopped before her. &#8220;And what&#8217;s to
become of <i>me</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;ll be with you almost as much
as ever. We&#8217;ve always been separated
most of the time&mdash;your fault, not mine.
And I&#8217;m not going to take Aunt Louisa
away from you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a heartless girl!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father, for several years you&#8217;ve been
urging me to marry. I&#8217;ve heard you tell
dozens of people that you wanted to see
your grandchildren.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the thought of <i>his</i> grandchildren the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
children of George Helm, Clearwater became
purple and abruptly left the room.
Also, he <i>had</i> been urging Eleanor to marry.</p>

<p>About an hour later, as he was at the
front door to motor to the club, he met
George Helm entering. He was so absorbed
in the attempt to conceal his anger
and hatred behind a manner of stiff politeness
that he did not really look at Helm,
therefore did not see Helm&#8217;s frigid bow far
more ominous than his own lack of cordiality.
&#8220;Impudent adventurer,&#8221; he muttered&mdash;when
there was not a possibility of
Helm&#8217;s hearing any faint rumble of that
carefully suppressed wrath. He cursed his
weakness of paternal affection, marveled at
his unaccountable lack of the courage to rise
up and put down the whole abominable
business.</p>

<p>At the club he took into his confidence
old Senator Tingley, his bosom friend and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
his partner in many a stealthy business adventure
which neither would have cared to
have had visited by any ray of the sunlight
of publicity. Business aside&mdash;how often it
is necessary to leave out of account a man&#8217;s
way of making his money!&mdash;business aside,
Tingley was a kindly old patriarch, as genial
as wise. Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;George, it&#8217;s the same old story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got her hypnotized,&#8221; said Clearwater.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like a child,&#8221; replied Tingley.
&#8220;Nature&#8217;s got her hypnotized. You could
have prevented this if you&#8217;d married her
off pretty soon after she got to the marriageable
age. She&#8217;s simply obeying nature that
refuses to be put off any longer. We parents
are damn fools not to realize that our children,
even our pure, innocent daughters, are
human.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearwater did not see how to deny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
Tingley&#8217;s unromantic but impressively simple
and sensible explanation. However, he
felt that he owed it to his daughter&#8217;s innocence
to say something in mitigation. Said
he:</p>

<p>&#8220;She seems to be in love with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And probably will be after they&#8217;re
married. Certainly will be, if he knows
his business at all. He&#8217;ll have the inside
track and it&#8217;ll be his fault if he don&#8217;t convince
her that he, the only man she ever
knew, is a wonder of a special creation.
She&#8217;ll never suspect that all men are pretty
much the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearwater winced before the frankness
of his friend, too old to make pretenses and
too wise to believe them. Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;Aaron, how can I break it up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;in a nominating convention, if
you want to beat a popular candidate,
you&#8217;ve got to have a man to beat him with.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
It&#8217;s the same way in these heart matters.
Find another man&mdash;one she&#8217;ll like better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearwater groaned. &#8220;These damned
young nincompoops you find round in
society!&#8221; he cursed. &#8220;Really I can&#8217;t blame
her for taking the first fellow with jump
and ginger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Tingley nodded. &#8220;The altar men&mdash;the
fellows that&#8217;ll marry young girls&mdash;do
seem to be mighty poor pickings. At least
here in Washington&mdash;in &#8216;our set.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>When Helm entered the presence of
Eleanor his manner had lost its frigidness
and reserve but none of the gravity. She
flung herself into his arms, clung to him
passionately with a complete giving up of
herself to her love for him. He held her,
he caressed her gently, he showed in every
look and gesture how deeply he loved her.
Yet&mdash;if she had not been so intoxicated by
her emotions, she would have felt, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
have seen that this peculiar young man not
only was master of her love but also was
master of his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>knew</i> you wouldn&#8217;t let anything come
between us,&#8221; said she. &#8220;George, how
wonderful it is to love a man one simply
couldn&#8217;t doubt. Do you feel that way
about me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re engaged,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve got to marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Father&#8217;ll get over this,&#8221; she assured him.
Helm shook his head. &#8220;No; he&#8217;ll be
worse and worse&mdash;more against me. It
can&#8217;t possibly be otherwise. When you go
with me, you leave him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not talk about that!&#8221; cried she.
&#8220;Since I&#8217;ve got to marry you&mdash;the rest
doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ve thought about it?&#8221; insisted
he. &#8220;You realize what you&#8217;re doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped his lips with her fingers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>He kissed her finger tips and put them
aside&mdash;with the compelling look of his eyes
rather than with his gentle hand. He
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You understand you&#8217;re leaving your
class and coming to mine&mdash;and that the
war between these two classes is going to
be bitter and more bitter until&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s a long ways off. George,&#8221;
she said abruptly, &#8220;let&#8217;s get married at
once&mdash;to-day&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;as soon as we
can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you wish it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled tenderly. &#8220;I&#8217;m married to
you already&mdash;for good and all.&#8221; He held
her tightly in his long arms that gave her
such a sense of peace and security. &#8220;For
ever&mdash;and ay, Ellen.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was sobbing. &#8220;Oh&mdash;I&#8217;m so happy&mdash;so
happy,&#8221; she murmured.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>&#8220;But you must tell me why you want to
marry at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it because you are nervous about&mdash;about
divided loyalty?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded, keeping her face hid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you do understand? You have
thought?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded. &#8220;And I know you&#8217;ll do
nothing but what you ought to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What I <i>have</i> to do,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to enforce the laws. I&#8217;m going to
ask for more laws of the kind that are for
the benefit of the whole people&mdash;and I&#8217;m
going to get them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to attack&mdash;father?&#8221; she
said, speaking as if she were compelled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably you&#8217;ve heard of Voltaire&#8217;s
dilemma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose there were a button before you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
and by pressing it you could have your
heart&#8217;s dearest wish&mdash;wealth, fame, power,
love, happiness&mdash;but if you did press that
button, instantly a human being away off
in China would fall dead. It might be an
old man about to die anyhow&mdash;or horribly
diseased&mdash;or some dreadful criminal&mdash;or
the mother of some baby needing all her
love and care&mdash;or the father and only
support of a family&mdash;or some girl like
yourself, about to marry and be happy. You
would never know whom you had killed;
but&mdash;some one would be dead. Would you
press the button or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that terrible!&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, in these days the gentlemen who
are so eager to be very rich have constructed
a button&mdash;the corporation. It gives them
their dearest wish&mdash;wealth and power. It
removes responsibility away off, beyond
their sight. They do not hesitate. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
press the button. And then, away off, beyond
their sight, so far from them that
they can pretend&mdash;can make many believe,
including themselves&mdash;that they really
didn&#8217;t know and don&#8217;t know what the <i>other</i>
consequences of pressing the button are&mdash;away
off there, as the button is pressed, people
die, people starve, babies are slaughtered,
misery blackens countless lives. The
prosperous, respectable gentlemen press the
button. And not they, but the corporation
grabs public property&mdash;bribes public officials&mdash;hires
men they never see to do their
dirty work, their cruel work, their work of
shame and death. They press the button&mdash;and
the dividends pour in&mdash;and they ignore
and forget the rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long silence. He sat in one of his favorite
attitudes&mdash;body bent forward, elbow
on knees, eyes staring at the carpet. She
slowly smoothed down first one sleeve of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
her blouse, then the other. At last she
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;that is it. I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t take any of that money.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again silence. Then she:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, George&mdash;we can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are <i>sure</i> you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ever since we became engaged I&#8217;ve been
getting ready to be your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no secret hope&mdash;perhaps unknown
to yourself&mdash;that I will change&mdash;will
join your class?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a while&mdash;last spring&mdash;I had,&#8221; she
confessed. &#8220;But soon&mdash;when I knew you
better&mdash;and understood your speeches&mdash;then
I didn&#8217;t want you to change.&#8221; She
smiled quizzically&mdash;&#8220;not even your tailor.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked down at the new suit in which
he thought himself almost too fine. But
he couldn&#8217;t see how characteristically it
bunched and bagged upon his figure intolerant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
of fashionable clothing. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
like this suit?&#8221; he inquired anxiously. &#8220;I
got it to please you. I hoped you&#8217;d like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>love</i> it,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t
have you changed one least little bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go get the license. We
can marry to-morrow&mdash;and start for home.
We can stop off and look at Niagara Falls
if you like. I&#8217;ve never seen it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed and hugged him. He thought
it was altogether because of the decision
about the marriage. &#8220;Yes&mdash;do let&#8217;s take in
Niagara,&#8221; she said, and she laughed again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a lot to do before inauguration,&#8221;
he went on. &#8220;After we get to Harrison I
may not be able to spend much time with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How much&#8217;ll we have to live on,
George?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;lots of money. The salary&#8217;s eight
thousand a year. We&#8217;re going to live very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
simply. I don&#8217;t believe in acting the way
our governors have been acting lately. We
mustn&#8217;t forget that we are working for the
people&mdash;and that they are very poor. I
take it that you don&#8217;t care for luxury&mdash;or
you wouldn&#8217;t have bothered with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care for anything but you,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;And I know what I&#8217;m about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll soon get your bearings, and
we&#8217;ll be saving money. We&#8217;ve got to live
after we get out, you know. And I may not
be able to make as much as eight thousand
at lecturing and law&mdash;<i>my</i> kind of law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about that,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>He laid his hands on her shoulders and
looked straight into her eyes. Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;You understand that I mean what I say,
Ellen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;George.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that it isn&#8217;t going to be any different
with me after we&#8217;re married.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>&#8220;It mustn&#8217;t be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of your class&mdash;into mine&mdash;to stay
there, Ellen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To stay there. I&#8217;ve learned about the
men who use the people to step up on, and
then turn traitors. I am marrying your life,
George. You are not marrying mine&mdash;what
mine has been.&#8221;</p>

<p>They looked at each other gravely. And
it was then and there that they took their
real marriage vows.</p>

<p>The ceremony in the large drawing-room
two days later was less impressive. In fact,
it was absurd, as marriage ceremonies in the
customary surroundings of pretentiousness
usually are&mdash;to all who have an unspoiled
sense of humor. The fussy and angry father,
alternating thoughts of tenderness with
longings to slay&mdash;the solemn-ass preacher in
robes, with affected voice and sycophant
manner toward rich Senator Clearwater&mdash;the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
pretty grotesque accidents due to the
agitation of Eleanor and the awkwardness
of the lank and long governor-elect&mdash;the
snufflings and weepings of Aunt
Louisa, glad Eleanor was making a marriage
that improved the prospects of her
own grown and married children for a
large share of the Clearwater fortune&mdash;these
and all other absurdities and hypocrisies
made the wedding something
for the happy pair to joke about on the
train.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much did you tell Mr. Desbrough
to give the clergyman?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>George blushed. &#8220;I was going to give
him twenty-five, but Bill said he was such
a swell he must have fifty. So I had to let
it go at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Weakening already!&#8221; mocked she. &#8220;Five
dollars would have been too much. He&#8217;s a
frightful cad&mdash;always fawning on rich people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
and hunting a rich wife&mdash;and he a servant
of Jesus Christ.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to look after the money, Ellen,&#8221;
confessed Helm. &#8220;I&#8217;m a fool about it.
I&#8217;ve got mighty little use for the blamed
stuff, anyhow. Besides, it&#8217;ll give you something
to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him with a shrewd smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to test me?&mdash;isn&#8217;t that
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded. &#8220;I want to find out just what
you&#8217;ve got to learn. Just because I <i>had</i> to
go into this, I didn&#8217;t go in blind. I can&#8217;t
do things that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ve both been doing a lot of
thinking since last spring.&#8221; She slipped
her hand into his. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ve
got to learn, but I do know that I&#8217;m going
to learn it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her, with that expression
in his eyes which gave her the sense of love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
and strength and tenderness superhuman.
He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I can count on you, Ellen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As long as you look at me like that,&#8221;
said she, &#8220;I&#8217;ll not ever be anything but
happy. I&#8217;d not be a woman, if I were.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE TEST</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN the large back yard of the &#8220;Executive
Mansion&#8221; the young governor,
George Helm, was wheeling his first
born&mdash;George Helm, also&mdash;up and down
the shady central walk in a perambulator
of the latest scientific make. The baby was
giving the healthy baby&#8217;s fascinating exhibition
of the fathomless peace and content
that can be got only from sleep. The Governor
and Bill Desbrough, the state Attorney-General
and his one really intimate
friend, were talking politics. At the window
of the sitting-room sat Eleanor Helm,
sewing&mdash;when she was not watching the two
Georges&mdash;<i>her</i> two Georges.</p>

<p>There are two things as brief as any in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
this world of brevities&mdash;the babyhood of her
first born to the mother who loves babies,
and his term of office to the public man who
loves office. It so happened that both these
befell the Helms at the same time. George
married Eleanor Clearwater, daughter of
the lumber king and United States Senator,
a few weeks before he was inaugurated;
and the first baby came toward the end of
the second year of that famous stormy term
of his. It was now the spring of his fourth
year as governor. Both he and the young
woman at the window looked younger than
when they married&mdash;without the consent
which her father dared not publicly withhold,
or indeed privately, since he had not
the courage to cut himself off from his only
child. The reason the hands were turning
backward for Helm and his wife was, of
course, happiness. A man often loves a
woman&mdash;a girl&mdash;for the possibilities he sees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
in her which he fancies he can realize. Indeed
one of woman&#8217;s best beguilements for
&#8220;leading on&#8221; the man she wants is the subtle
creating or encouragement of this same
fancy. But when a woman really does love
a man, she loves him for himself, wishes
him to stay exactly as he is. Eleanor had
taken the lank, tall, rural-looking impersonation
of strength, gentleness and self-unconscious
simplicity because that was
what she wanted. Having got it and finding
that it did not change, she proceeded to
be happy. The slovenly woman&#8217;s way of
being happy is to go to pieces. The energetic
and self-respecting woman&#8217;s way is to
&#8220;take a fresh grip.&#8221; Mrs. George Helm
was younger than she had been since early
girlhood. She felt utterly and blissfully
irresponsible; had she not her George, and
had not he taken everything on his shoulders&mdash;except
looking after the money-spending,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
the house&mdash;and the baby? The
house and the baby were a delight. Looking
after the house meant making big
George comfortable; looking after the baby
meant making little George comfortable.
As for the money, that was simple enough.
In the first place, there wasn&#8217;t much of it;
in the second place, George gave it all to
her and meekly accepted the small allowance
for pocket money&mdash;all he was fit to be
trusted with.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bill,&#8221; said George to the lazy friend
whom he had made into his political manager
and had forced to take the office of
Attorney-General&mdash;&#8220;Bill, you ought to get
married. My wife takes all the responsibilities
off my shoulders and leaves me free
just to have fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bill was amused. Only a few minutes
before Mrs. Helm had told him that a sensible
woman&mdash;meaning, of course, herself&mdash;always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
chose a man she could trust and then
turned over to him all the responsibilities
and gave herself up to love and happiness.</p>

<p>George Helm&#8217;s reason for looking younger
was somewhat different. That is, he got
the happiness in a different way. Much is
said about the heavy cares of office, and certainly
most men in high office do age rapidly.
But Helm&#8217;s notion of the duties of office
was not that usually held by officials. If a
man spends his time at secretly doing things
which would ruin him, were they found out&mdash;if
he hides service of thieves and plunderers
behind a pretense of public service, naturally
he grows old rapidly. Such secrets
and such terrors loosen the hair and the
teeth, stoop the shoulders, yellow the fat and
sag and wrinkle the cheeks. But if a man
has no secrets in his public service, if he
spends each day in the rejuvenating effort
to do the square thing without troubling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
himself in the least about whether he will
be misunderstood, or maligned, or beaten
for a second term, he gets younger and happier
all the time. For health and vitalizing
no other vacation equals the vacation from
lying and swindling and double-dealing and
plotting that make up the routine of so
many lives.</p>

<p>As the two men and the baby carriage
reached the far end of the walk, Bill said:</p>

<p>&#8220;George, it&#8217;s a wonder you aren&#8217;t wheeling
this cart up and down the main street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too much noise and dust,&#8221; replied the
governor. &#8220;Bad for the fat one.&#8221; He
usually called his namesake &#8220;the fat one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done about everything else I can
think of to get everybody down on you.
You&#8217;ve made the politicians hate you by
forcing through decent primary and election
laws. You&#8217;ve got the railroads and the
big businesses down on you by making them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
pay taxes and obey the laws. You&#8217;ve got
the farmers down on you by giving the railroads
the excuse of their taxes for raising
rates. You&#8217;ve got the breweries down on
you by shutting up a lot of their doggeries
and enforcing an inspection of their beer.
You&#8217;ve got the merchants down on you by
making them toe the mark on false weights
and measures. You&#8217;ve got the men down
on you because they say your &#8216;honest&#8217; administration
has made business bad, and increased
the unemployed. You&#8217;ve got the
women down on you because you and your
wife haven&#8217;t been social snobs and givers of
swell entertainments, as governors and their
wives always have been hitherto&mdash;and are
expected to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>George listened, much amused. &#8220;No
friends left but you, Bill,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t succeeded in pleasing anybody
on earth.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>&#8220;Except myself,&#8221; said Helm.</p>

<p>They had turned and were once more
moving toward the house&mdash;toward the
young woman at the window. &#8220;Yourself&mdash;and
your wife,&#8221; said Desbrough.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said George. He was looking
at her. His eyes always changed expression
when he looked at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you took this office, you said you
were going to please the people,&#8221; pursued
Bill.</p>

<p>&#8220;To <i>serve</i> the people,&#8221; corrected Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Same thing,&#8221; rejoined his friend. &#8220;Now&mdash;you&#8217;ve
found out that there isn&#8217;t any such
thing as the people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are a lot of interests of one kind
and another, big and little. The masses are
employed by them to produce and are their
customers as consumers. The interests rob
them, both ways from the Jack.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>Helm nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are pluckers and plucked, but
there is no such thing as &#8216;the people.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; admitted Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been serving something that
doesn&#8217;t exist.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;The pluckers hate you because you&#8217;ve
interfered with their game. The plucked
hate you because they think you&#8217;ve put
them in a position where they&#8217;ll not be
plucked only because they haven&#8217;t anything
to pluck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t hate me, exactly,&#8221; said
George.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right. I withdraw hate. They
love you. They go crazy at sight of you.
They flock to hear you speak and they cheer
you until you have to stop them to get
through your speech. But&mdash;that doesn&#8217;t
fool you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>&#8220;Not for a minute,&#8221; replied Helm.
&#8220;They think I mean well but am&mdash;dangerous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You hypnotized them two years ago,&#8221;
Desbrough went on, &#8220;and induced them to
give you a legislature that had to put
through your program. But the pluckers
have organized and have put that fox
Sayler in charge again&mdash;and they&#8217;ve got
your humble friends of the workshop and
the plow good and scared at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t bring you here to-day, Bill,
to talk about my political fortunes. What&#8217;s
become of those Western Timber cases?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those cases you asked me to get up
against the Western Timber and Mineral
Company?&#8221; said Desbrough with a curious
change of voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; said Helm. &#8220;My wife wants
the baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>Desbrough waited. Helm disappeared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
with the carriage at the half-basement door;
Mrs. Helm disappeared from the window.
Affairs of state had to wait full ten minutes.
Then Helm rejoined his friend with
an expression of intense, if somewhat guilty,
pleasure that gave the shrewd Attorney-General
a clue to what had occurred
within. Said Helm, with renewed vigor:</p>

<p>&#8220;What about those cases, Bill? You
lazy pup! I&#8217;ve had to nag at you ever since
we got in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I done all you asked?&#8221; laughed
Desbrough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;and done it well, Bill. But&mdash;how
I have had to nag!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; been better for you, if I hadn&#8217;t
done so much. You&#8217;ve tried to set the world
straight, George, in one term as governor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wrong there, old man,&#8221; replied
Helm. &#8220;I&#8217;ve simply settled each question
as it came up. It had to be settled one way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
or the other. I haven&#8217;t had time to do anything
but just the things that were squarely
put up to me to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Desbrough&#8217;s shrug was admission that
George had spoken exactly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t blame
you, George,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But you see how
it is. Didn&#8217;t I warn you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I was playing bad politics? Oh,
yes. And I knew it. I knew how to get in,
Bill. I knew how to stay in. But when it
came to a show-down I couldn&#8217;t do a dozen
rotten things in order to get through one
that was half way decent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;you&#8217;ll go out, and somebody
that&#8217;s altogether rotten&#8217;ll come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about those cases?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take them up in a few days.&#8221; Desbrough
was trying to hide his nervousness
from his keen-eyed friend. &#8220;Give me another
week, George.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm laid a heavy hand on Desbrough&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
shoulder. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>Desbrough saw he could not evade.
&#8220;This Western Timber and Mineral Company&mdash;the
T. and M., as they call it&mdash;it&#8217;s a
queer sort of holding corporation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the worst thief in this part of the
world&mdash;a waster and a stealer and a
starver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s a clever villain&mdash;the cleverest.
It&#8217;s got safety hooks and lines out in every
direction. If you attack it you&#8217;ll get a
return volley from pretty near everything
that has a voice in this state&mdash;newspapers,
preachers, charity societies of every kind,
doctors, lawyers, retailers. It&#8217;s wound
round everything and everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the big waster, the big stealer, the
big starver&mdash;and the big corruption. Now,
it has defied the government of this state&mdash;the
people.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>&#8220;The people doesn&#8217;t exist,&#8221; Desbrough reminded
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s got to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;First crack out of the box&mdash;as soon as I
begin to attack&mdash;it will close a lot of plants
and throw fifty thousand workers&mdash;men,
women and children&mdash;out of employment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that as bad as what it&#8217;s doing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted Desbrough. &#8220;Not one
hundredth part as bad. But it&#8217;ll <i>look</i> worse.
Everybody will think and say it&#8217;s worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you afraid of, Bill? I know it
isn&#8217;t yourself. <i>What</i> is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Desbrough looked steadily at his friend.
&#8220;You know what the T. &amp; M. is&mdash;<i>who</i> it
really is?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody especial?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s controlled by&mdash;your father-in-law.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was by no means the first time that
George Helm had been faced with the difficulties
necessarily involved in his having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
married the daughter of one of the leading
politico-business traffickers of the Middle
West. But theretofore each difficulty had
come in some form that enabled him to keep
on his course without wounding his wife&#8217;s
sensibilities, and with no other ill effect than
deepening his father-in-law&#8217;s secret hatred
and detestation. But now the long-dreaded
crisis seemed to have come.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve warned that company several
times,&#8221; said he, reflecting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Five formal warnings,&#8221; said Desbrough.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve just given them a sixth. That&#8217;s why
I&#8217;m delaying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Six. That&#8217;s too many. We&#8217;ve been
more than fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;George, if I go ahead&mdash;I send two of
your wife&#8217;s own cousins to the pen&mdash;and disgrace
her father&mdash;drive him out of public
life.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long silence. Then Helm said quietly:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>&#8220;Do you think they&#8217;ll pay attention to
the warning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Desbrough. He watched
the lines growing slowly taut in George
Helm&#8217;s rugged face, and hastily added,
&#8220;Now, see here, old man&mdash;for God&#8217;s sake
<i>don&#8217;t</i> do another unpractical thing&mdash;the
worst yet. The others only wrecked you
politically. This&#8217;ll wreck your home.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the same tranquil way Helm said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I ever done a single unpractical
thing? You know I haven&#8217;t. You know&mdash;or
ought to&mdash;that Sayler&mdash; There&#8217;s a politician!&mdash;he
put up the whole game on me.
He fixed it so that I&#8217;d be forced either to do
dirty work or to offend one after another
every power in this state and so kill myself
politically.&#8221;</p>

<p>Desbrough suddenly saw the whole plot&mdash;simple,
devilish, inevitably successful. And
all his love for Helm was concentrated in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
the deep, passionate fury of his exclamation&mdash;&#8220;The
dirty devil!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No use calling names,&#8221; rejoined Helm
placidly. &#8220;He plays his game; we play
ours. And anyhow, he has lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lost?&#8221; echoed Desbrough. &#8220;How do
you make that out? I think he&#8217;s won.
Hasn&#8217;t he done you up for a second term?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even so, still he has lost,&#8221; Helm answered.
&#8220;His main object was to make
us do dirty work. And we haven&#8217;t&mdash;not
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Desbrough&#8217;s eyes shifted. After a pause
he said with some constraint:</p>

<p>&#8220;You want me to wait till these people
have a chance to act on my last warning?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you an answer to-morrow.
You&#8217;re all ready to go ahead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;I&#8217;ll see you to-morrow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>And Desbrough did not envy him the rest
of that day and the night.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the afternoon, to the governor&#8217;s private
room in the Capitol came Harvey
Sayler. Nominally, Sayler was a rich
United States Senator and the state leader
of the Republican party machine. Actually,
he was the boss of the machines of both
parties, was an overlord of bosses, was the
plutocracy&#8217;s honored and courted major-general
for the Middle West. As the masses
in their slow, dim way were beginning to
realize that parties and politics were not
matters of principle but of pocket filling&mdash;and
pocket-emptying, Sayler was being
denounced, was being built up into a figure
of greater menace, and therefore of greater
public admiration and respect, than the
actualities warranted, powerful and dangerous
though he was. But he had remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
the affable, cynically good-humored good
fellow. Whenever one of the plutocracy&#8217;s
thoroughly pliant tools was in high office,
Sayler and he always pretended to quarrel,
got the newspapers to fool the public with
big headlines&mdash;&#8220;Fearless governor (or attorney-general
or judge) breaks with the
bosses&#8221;&mdash;and Sayler and he met only in the
stealthiest privacy, if meeting became necessary.
Whenever a more or less independent
man was in office, Sayler always kept on
terms of the greatest apparent friendliness
with him&mdash;for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>As Helm had shown in his talk with Bill
Desbrough, he understood Sayler. And
Sayler, knowing that he could gain nothing
by deceiving Helm in their personal talks,
gave himself the pleasure of being almost
frank.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Governor,&#8221; said he, &#8220;how goes the
game of honest politics?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>&#8220;I needn&#8217;t tell <i>you</i>,&#8221; replied Helm, good-humoredly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll some day see I was right when I
warned you there was no such thing as honest
politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did I ever deny it?&#8221; said Helm. &#8220;How
could there be honest politics? Human
society is, necessarily, modeled as yet upon
the only example man had to guide them&mdash;nature,
with her cruel law of the survival of
the fittest. Men live by taking advantage
of one another&mdash;of one another&#8217;s ignorance,
stupidity, necessity, cowardice. And politics&mdash;it&#8217;s
simply the struggle between warring
appetites, between competing selfishnesses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what&#8217;s the use of exhorting men to
stop robbing each other?&#8221; inquired Sayler.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t my plan the wiser&mdash;and the better?&mdash;to
try to show the strong that they shouldn&#8217;t
strip the weak&mdash;that they should content<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
themselves with all the harvest, and not uproot
and so prevent another harvest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I admit you have your usefulness,&#8221; replied
Helm. &#8220;But I insist that my sort of
politician is useful also. You are trying to
soften the strong, we to strengthen the weak.
But&#8221;&mdash;with eyes suddenly twinkling&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ve
been expecting you. I knew your plan
was about complete.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My plan?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been very cleverly forcing me
into a position where I&#8217;d have every interest,
big and little, in the state against me&mdash;a
position where it would be impossible for
me to get a second term&mdash;or any office.
Well&mdash;you&#8217;ve apparently got me where you
want me. So it&#8217;s time for you to make me a
proposition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler&#8217;s smile was admission.</p>

<p>&#8220;Incidentally,&#8221; pursued Helm, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
made me punish those of your plutocratic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
friends who were restless under your rule.
They are now all back at your feet, I believe?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler laughed. &#8220;All,&#8221; said he. &#8220;They&#8217;ll
not annoy me soon again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;what next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come to offer you <i>my</i> position,&#8221; was
Sayler&#8217;s unexpected and astounding offer.
&#8220;I am going to marry again, and the lady
does not like politics&mdash;my kind of politics&mdash;the
only kind I can play. Also, I&#8217;m tired.
I&#8217;d like to give my place to my colleague in
the Senate and first lieutenant, splendid old
Doc Woodruff. But he&#8217;s a born lieutenant.
He simply couldn&#8217;t learn to lead. So&mdash;I&#8217;ve
been training you for the job.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler evidently regarded it as a rare joke
that he, a plutocracy boss, had been training
the most radical and anti-plutocratic governor
in the Middle West&mdash;had been training
him to become the leader for the plutocracy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
Helm, recovering from his surprise,
was also amused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been teaching you the folly of your
ways. You have had a free hand. You
have done what was right. Result&mdash;general
dissatisfaction, general distrust of <i>you</i>,
general desire for a change back to us. The
people say&mdash;&#8216;Yes, those fellows steal almost
all the fruits of our labor. But they own
the mines and the shops and the railroads,
which practically means that they own the
land. If we want to earn a living for our
families, we&#8217;ve got to apply to them for permission
to work. The sensible thing for us
to do is to make the best terms we can. If
we took the property away from the plutocracy
we&#8217;d not get it, but our clever leaders
would, and they&#8217;d rob us just as we&#8217;re being
robbed now.&#8217; Isn&#8217;t that the way the people
reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much like that,&#8221; admitted Helm.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>&#8220;And there they show their shrewd sense.
Oh, the people aren&#8217;t fools&mdash;not altogether.
They have intelligence enough. What they
lack is <i>efficient</i> intelligence. They know,
but they don&#8217;t know how to use their
knowledge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re learning,&#8221; said Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean your independent following?
Yes&#8221;&mdash;Sayler nodded thoughtfully&mdash;&#8220;you
have done wonders. I&#8217;ve admired the way
you&#8217;ve built up a personal following of
nearly a hundred thousand votes. If we
didn&#8217;t happen to own both machines&mdash;and
therefore are indifferent which wins&mdash;your
following would give you the balance of
power. As matters stand, what is a hundred
thousand, when we have nearly half a million?&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm was silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see the situation as it is,&#8221; continued
Sayler. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I come to you. What<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
our side needs is another leader such as I&#8217;ve
tried to be&mdash;one who shows the plutocratic
fools their true interest&mdash;not to kill but to
pet and fatten the goose that lays the golden
eggs.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm was thinking. Sayler felt encouraged.
He went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;You can make yourself as rich as you
please. Or, you can remain poor, if you
like. You can&mdash;in fact, you must&mdash;keep
your independent following&mdash;and increase
it. It is the power you can use to keep your
plutocratic clients in order.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler observed the thoughtful face of
the young governor narrowly. Then he
went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s plenty of time to consider this
proposition of mine. I guess it will be attractive
or not to you according as you decide
that you can or cannot control your
plutocratic clients to reasonably, humanly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
decent conduct. I think you can. That&#8217;s
why I make you the offer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You had another matter about which
you wished to speak to me?&#8221; said Helm.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good guess. Yes&mdash;I want to talk T.
and M.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; said Helm. &#8220;Not to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you know that your father-in-law&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Being a public official, he&#8217;s had to keep
his corporation connections very dark indeed.
Perhaps I should have told you.
But I knew the secret in a way that made it
difficult for me to speak.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It didn&#8217;t matter,&#8221; said Helm, grimly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned in good time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler rose. &#8220;Your father-in-law telegraphs
me that he&#8217;ll arrive to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep him away from my house until
eleven to-morrow.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>&#8220;You wish to tell your wife first?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I shall let him tell her. But no
one ought to hear agitating news before the
middle of the morning&mdash;after the day is
well started but while there&#8217;s still most of
the day left for thinking it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sayler was touched by this evidence
of Helm&#8217;s minute thoughtfulness for the
woman he loved. &#8220;Thank you for that suggestion,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been letting my
secretary tell me all sorts of news at any
old time&mdash;with disastrous results to my
health. My compliments to your wife.
I&#8217;m hoping to see her before I go back to
Washington.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At noon the following day Helm left his
office&mdash;an hour earlier than usual&mdash;and
went home. At the sitting-room door he
paused. After a brief hesitation he opened
the door and entered. As he expected, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
were his wife and her father. Helm glanced
at the troubled face of his wife. Without
greeting his father-in-law he said to her:</p>

<p>&#8220;He has told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true then, George?&#8221; replied she.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>Clearwater interposed with angry dignity:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been laying the whole case before
my daughter, sir&mdash;your proposed attempt to
disgrace and to ruin me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm now looked at him. &#8220;You have
had six warnings,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You could
have made your corporation obey the laws&mdash;or
you could have sold your holdings and
gotten away from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have disobeyed no laws,&#8221; retorted
Clearwater. &#8220;We have simply disregarded
alleged laws enacted by demagogues to
compel us to pay blackmail or go out of
business.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>&#8220;Your own lawyers drew the laws,&#8221; replied
Helm, &#8220;and Sayler ordered them
passed six years ago. But they were intended
for use against any rival to your
monopoly that might spring up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll let us alone, or you&#8217;ll never hold
another office in this state,&#8221; cried Clearwater.
&#8220;I came here to ask my daughter to
use her influence with you to save yourself
from destruction. I had forgotten what an
obstinate visionary you were. But I think
even you will hesitate before breaking her
heart, bowing her head with shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told father,&#8221; said Eleanor, &#8220;that
I haven&#8217;t any influence with you. I&#8217;d not
venture to speak to you about a political
matter&mdash;unless I understood it. And I&#8217;ve
been so busy with the baby these last two
years that I don&#8217;t really know anything any
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor, I&#8217;ve explained it all to you,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
said Clearwater, deeply agitated. &#8220;If he
goes on, it means disgrace to me. I can
punish him&mdash;and I shall. But I&#8217;ll have to
leave public life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor looked inquiringly at her husband.
He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;George, you can&#8217;t do that!&#8221; cried she.</p>

<p>Helm winced. He said gravely:</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father&mdash;through his corporation&mdash;put
it squarely up to me either to prosecute
him or to re-license his corporation for robbing
the people of this state.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lie!&#8221; cried Clearwater. &#8220;It&#8217;s
as honest a business as there is!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Helm, &#8220;it&#8217;s as honest a <i>big</i>
business as there is&mdash;and as dishonest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t disgrace <i>my</i> father, George,&#8221;
said Eleanor. &#8220;You can&#8217;t send my cousins
to the penitentiary. Why, they&#8217;re like my
brothers.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>Helm looked gravely at her. He said
slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are their cousin. You are Senator
Clearwater&#8217;s daughter. But you are my
wife&mdash;you are our son&#8217;s mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was deathly pale, and her eyes looked
her terror, as she said breathlessly:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>My</i> father! Oh, George, you <i>can&#8217;t</i>!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Helm gently. &#8220;I can&mdash;and I
must&mdash;and, Ellen, I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> asking me to choose between you
and my father!&#8221; exclaimed she.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Ellen,&#8221; replied he. &#8220;I am your
husband. There can&#8217;t be any choice between
me and any one else on earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>They gazed at each other, he as white as
she. But she was trembling, while he stood
like a strong tree. She said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;I am yours, George. But&mdash;you
will give me a wound I&#8217;ll never recover
from.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>He said: &#8220;It will give <i>us</i> a wound
that&#8217;ll never heal. But&mdash;we&#8217;ll suffer together,
my love, as we have been happy together.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearwater watched them with awe. It
was the first time in all his life that he had
ever seen love&mdash;the reality of love. And
the sight was so overpowering that it overwhelmed
his emotions of terror and rage
and hate. When he finally spoke it was
with a kind of hysteria:</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, Eleanor! If your dead mother
could have known that her daughter&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm put his arm round his wife and interrupted
sternly:</p>

<p>&#8220;If her dead mother could have seen you
at your deviltry through that corporation&mdash;could
have seen the starving wretches in
your lumber camps&mdash;the blighted children
toiling in your mines, the blood and filth on
your dividend dollars, every one of them!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>&#8220;He lies, Eleanor!&#8221; cried her father.
&#8220;He is a half-crazed crank&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is my husband, father,&#8221; interrupted
Eleanor. And very proud she looked as she
said it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will do nothing to help me!&#8221; cried
her father, in a sudden agony of fear.</p>

<p>Eleanor was about to reply. Helm shook
his head, led her gently toward the door.
He said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave us alone, please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor,&#8221; shrieked her father, &#8220;if you
yield to this man, if you give up your father
to be destroyed by him, I shall disinherit
you, I shall curse you. I shall curse you.
I shall curse you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The daughter shivered from head to foot.
Helm bore her firmly on, released her at the
threshold. She cried, &#8220;George, let me stay!
Please, dear! Let me talk with both of you.
You are both so hard&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>Her voice had been faltering, for again
he had fixed her gaze with those kind, inflexible
eyes of his. She became silent. In
the hall he kissed her, released her. Then
he returned to the sitting-room, closing the
door behind him. He said to Clearwater,
quietly, almost gently:</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better tell your corporation to
yield. If you don&#8217;t, it will break her heart,
as you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will not yield!&#8221; cried Clearwater,
shaking his fist in Helm&#8217;s face. &#8220;And after
you have actually done your dastardly work,
she will hate you. You think you own her,
body and soul. You&#8217;ll find out afterward.
She will hate you, she will leave you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will neither leave me, nor hate
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was in his voice the finality not of
mere conviction, but of truth itself. For
he knew&mdash;as only those who really love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
and really are loved know&mdash;what he and his
wife were to each other&mdash;the union that is a
fusion which not even death can dissolve.</p>

<p>After a pause he went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I tell the attorney-general that
formal notice of yielding will come to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence. Then Clearwater sullenly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Day after to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Helm reflected, said: &#8220;That will do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have won,&#8221; sneered Clearwater.
&#8220;Not much of a victory. You knew you
could count on her, hard-hearted fool that
she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count on her?&#8221; replied Helm, tranquilly.
&#8220;As on myself. And I may add
that I knew what <i>you</i> would do. What else
could you do, if you failed to make my wife
turn traitor and ask me to dishonor myself
that you might go on robbing. Don&#8217;t try
to shift and twist out of your agreement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
with me. Next time there will be no warning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Clearwater reduced himself to the calm
fury that is looking forward with a kind of
serenity to a certain and complete revenge.
Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the last year you&#8217;ll ever hold
office in this state&mdash;or anywhere in this
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then your people have to live decent
only about eight months longer,&#8221; was
Helm&#8217;s amiable rejoinder. &#8220;I guess they
can manage it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going,&#8221; said Clearwater, moving
toward the door. &#8220;I hope I shall never see
either of you again. I shall hound you both
into poverty. Then&mdash;if you wish me to take
the child, I&#8217;ll take it&mdash;provided you give me
full possession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall remember,&#8221; said Helm, simply.</p>

<p>His manner was that of a man who has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
nothing to say, who will answer any direct
question with unruffled courtesy, who will
listen as long as his visitor wishes to talk,
and patiently. Clearwater, discouraged,
cast about for some speech that would help
him out of the room. He could find none.
So he abruptly departed, feeling more uncomfortable
than angry. He could not
understand his own feelings, his unprecedented
lack of spirit. It did not occur to
him that Helm, matchless as a manager of
men, and far Clearwater&#8217;s superior in intelligence,
might have been responsible for
this puzzling state of his.</p>

<p>As soon as his father-in-law had had time
to get clear of the house, Helm went up to
his wife. The &#8220;fat one&#8221; was solemnly inspecting
his bright blocks in the middle of
the floor. Eleanor was sitting by the window,
gazing out into the tree-tops. She
slowly became conscious that her husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>
was at the threshold. She turned her eyes
toward him.</p>

<p>Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s gone. He has agreed to yield. So
the prosecution won&#8217;t be necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instead of the expression of relief he expected,
she looked as if she had not heard.
She came toward him; she laid her hands
upon his shoulders and looked up at him.
The &#8220;fat one&#8221; paused in the inspection of a
block to observe them&mdash;his father and
mother; he was trying hard to get acquainted
with them, and to make them
acquainted with him.</p>

<p>Eleanor said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I never knew until to-day what love
meant&mdash;and that I loved you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed gently, and gently kissed her.
There were tears in his eyes. The &#8220;fat
one&#8221; dropped the block and opened wide
his mouth and shut tight his eyes and emitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
a lusty howl&mdash;the beginning of a series
that was suspended by his lapsing into his
bad habit of holding his breath. Eleanor
caught him up and tried to shake him back
to howling. But he continued to hold his
breath, to grow a deeper and deeper purple.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he only wouldn&#8217;t do that!&#8221; cried she.
&#8220;I thought he was cured of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give him to me, mother,&#8221; said George,
intensely alarmed, though he knew the baby
would come out of it all right. He handled
the &#8220;fat one&#8221; awkwardly, but it was touching
as well as amusing to see the little creature
in those long arms. He and Eleanor
shook and patted and pleaded. But not until
they were quite beside themselves did the
&#8220;fat one&#8221; consent to resume. With a gurgle
and gasp he suddenly expelled the long-held
breath in a whoop and a shriek&mdash;a hideous
sound, but how it thrilled those two frightened
parents!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>&#8220;I really ought to spank him,&#8221; said Ellen
with a hysterical laugh. &#8220;He does it on
purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You fat rascal!&#8221; said George, waving a
long forefinger at his son. The fat one
seized it and abruptly began to smile.
Peace being thus restored, George&mdash;of an
analytical mind&mdash;said: &#8220;Whatever possessed
him to burst out that way?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor laughed. &#8220;I think he was jealous,&#8221;
she suggested. She kissed the &#8220;fat
one&#8221; tenderly. &#8220;And he had reason to be,&#8221;
she added.</p>

<p>They played on the floor with the baby
and the blocks&mdash;no; they played, using the
baby and the blocks as an excuse. After a
while George said:</p>

<p>&#8220;How little do you suppose we can live
on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, as little as anybody,&#8221; replied she
carelessly, intent upon the house of blocks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span>
they were making. &#8220;You see, so long as
we&#8217;ve got ourselves, we don&#8217;t need much
else. You&#8217;re building your side too
thin.&#8221;</p>

<p>George filled out the lower walls with a
second row, like the walls on her side.
Said he:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sayler offered me his job&mdash;running the
two machines.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor gave a faint smile of amusement&mdash;as
much attention as she could spare for
an &#8220;outside&#8221; matter when she was teaching
the &#8220;fat one&#8217;s&#8221; clumsy hands to lay blocks
straight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I ask him to dinner when I see
him this afternoon, to thank him and tell
him I won&#8217;t take it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;do ask him,&#8221; said Ellen. &#8220;He
brought us together&mdash;when you were trying
to get away. No, baby, not that way&mdash;the
long side across.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>&#8220;Your father told me he was going to cut
you off&mdash;and the baby, too, unless we gave
it to him to raise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ellen smiled&mdash;amused, a little sad. She
said: &#8220;Poor papa! He ought to be
ashamed of himself for trying to interfere
between you and me.&#8221; A pause of several
minutes, filled with building&mdash;repairing the
ravages of a wild thrust of the &#8220;fat one&#8217;s&#8221;
fists. Then her mind went back to what he
had said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose he will cut us off,&#8221; observed
she. &#8220;I knew it would come to that, when
we married. I&#8217;m sorry. You might have
used the money in your politics.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said George, working steadily
away at the castle. &#8220;Money&#8217;s of no use in
our kind of politics, Ellen. It&#8217;s been tried
again and again. It always fails. You see,
we&#8217;re trying to make everybody see that it&#8217;s
to his interest to wake up and work. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
the only money we want is what our people
must learn to invest, themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor was building a tower now, and
delicate work it was. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you have
let me take it, George, if he had given it to
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said George. &#8220;We don&#8217;t need it,
and we&#8217;d not let the baby be spoiled by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>A long and busy pause, then Eleanor:
&#8220;I&#8217;ve known <i>some</i> nice people with money.
But they&#8217;d have been nicer, I guess, without
it. It&#8217;s so hard to have friends or to be
friends if one has money&mdash;lots of money.
George Helm, do untwist your legs. You&#8217;ll
get awful cramps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re used to it,&#8221; replied the governor
and statesman. &#8220;Now, listen! now, fat one!&#8221;</p>

<p>And with a wild shout of glee the &#8220;fat
one&#8221; fell upon the finished castle, fist and
foot, and demolished it, and rolled in the
ruins with his father and mother mauling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span>
him and each other. The waitress, coming
to announce lunch, caught them. But she
was used to it. She laughed at them and
they laughed back at her. On the way
down, George said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve figured it all out. I could force
them to give me a second term. But I want
to get my independent movement under
way. So I&#8217;ll let Sayler and Hazelrigg do as
they like, and I&#8217;ll run independent&mdash;and
take a defeat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to get away from this
house,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;I sometimes think
it&#8217;s damp and bad for the baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll be back here in a few years, all
right,&#8221; said George. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a lot of work
to do in this job of governor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;by that time the baby won&#8217;t any
longer be a baby&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped short on the stairway. &#8220;Oh,
George!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a <i>frightful</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>
thought! If we could only keep him as he
is&mdash;and ourselves as we are&mdash;always!&#8221;</p>

<p>George did not like the thought either.
But he said cheeringly, &#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll find
as many things to like in to-morrow as we&#8217;ve
found in to-day. Anyhow, let&#8217;s hope so.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave his arm a squeeze. &#8220;<i>Hope</i> so?
We <i>know</i> so! As many things? More
things, George&mdash;every day more and more
things&mdash;to like&mdash;to love&mdash;to live for.&#8221;</p>

<p>George was suddenly so happy that he
carried her and the baby the rest of the way
down stairs&mdash;she in one arm, the baby in
the other, with equal ease. What a good old
world it was, after all&mdash;if one only took it
right! The one thing it lacked was &#8220;the
people.&#8221; If there were a real &#8220;people&#8221;&mdash;intelligent,
persistent, not easily fooled, no
longer conquerable and easy to rob and oppress
through their ignorance and their
prejudices&mdash;if there were &#8220;the people,&#8221; refusing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
to be ruled except by and for themselves,
what a heaven of a world it would
become! Well&mdash;the thing to do was to fall
to and do his share toward making this
&#8220;people.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were at lunch&mdash;a little table, he, his
wife, the baby in a high-chair. George and
Eleanor looked at each other, and their eyes
filled; for the same thought came to both.
The &#8220;fat one&#8221; halted his spoon on its way
to his mouth and looked inquiringly from
one to the other. Said she unsteadily,
laughing to keep from crying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, George&mdash;don&#8217;t look at me like
that. We&#8217;ll make the baby cry.&#8221;</p>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
